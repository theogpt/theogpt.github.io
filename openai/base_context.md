Additional important considerations:
1. Translate very carefully. Make your translations concise, accurate and well written.
2. Make a draft translation first, add +++++ on a new line, and compare your draft translation with the original text; find and summarize mistakes (in english) in your draft translation; add +++++ on a new line, and write the final translation, taking into account your draft translation, the found mistakes and the original text.
3. Prefer simple language. Especially avoid the use of passive voice, when active voice would have the same meaning.
4. Make translations paragraph-by-paragraph, so your output shall have the same number of paragraphs as the input text.
5. Chapter titles shall be in Camel Case, even if the original text has them in ALL CAPS.
