## Предисловие Автора

Когда я сочинял «Скрытую Жизнь в Масонстве», сначала я наметил посвятить вторую главу краткому изложению истории масонства. Но скоро я осознал, что этот план неосуществим. Даже самое концентрированное изложение, которое было бы полезно, заняло бы гораздо больше места, чем я мог бы предоставить, и загрузило бы книгу темой, которая, по сути, является только одной из ее аспектов. Очевидной альтернативой стало отдельное издание исторического обзора; отсюда эту книгу, которая, фактически, лишь второй том предыдущей.

Основная тема обоих томов, и, в самом деле, их единственной причиной издания, является внятное объяснение, что подразумевает заглавие - скрытая жизнь в масонстве - могущественные силы на заднем плане, всегда находящиеся в работе, но всегда невидимые, которые направляли передачу масонской традиции сквозь все вихри её бурной истории, и по-прежнему вдохновляют к наивысшему энтузиазму и самоотверженности среди братьев по Мастерству сегодня.

Существование и деятельность Главы всех истинных масонов - это едва ли не единственная и вполне достаточная причина для жизненной силы и энергетики этой удивительной организации. Если мы поймем его отношение к ней и что он хочет сделать из неё, мы также поймем, что это вопущение одной из блестящих схем когда-либо придуманных для помощи миру и для излияния духовной силы.

Многие из наших братьев уже многие годы, зачастую неосознанно, принимают участие в этом великолепном альтруистическом деле; если они смогут осознать, что именно они делают и почему, они продолжат великую работу более счастливо и осознанно, вложив в неё всю силу своей природы, как телесную, так и духовную, и наслаждаясь плодами своих трудов намного определеннее, чем когда-либо ранее.

Школы Масонской Мысли

Писать историю масонства - непростое дело, требующее энциклопедических знаний и многих лет исследований. У меня нет претензий на обладание качествами и образованием, необходимыми для создания такого труда; всё, что я могу предложить - это пролить немного света на некоторые темные пятна в этой истории и в некотором роде преодолеть пропасти между ней, которые уже известны.

Происхождение Масонства

Реальные истоки масонства, как я уже упоминал в предыдущей книге, затеряны в туманах давности. Масонские писатели XVIII века наивно спекулировали его историей, опираясь на буквальное верование в историю и хронологию Ветхого Завета, а также на странные легенды о Мастерстве, передаваемые с оперативных времен в Старых Уставах. Так, доктор Андерсон вполне серьезно заявил в своей первой Книге Уставов, что "Адам, наш первый родитель, созданный по образу Бога, великого архитектора Вселенной, обязательно имел на сердце записанные Свободные Науки, особенно Геометрию", в то время другие, менее фантастичные, приписывали его происхождение Аврааму, Моисею или Соломону. Доктор Оливер, писавший в начале XIX века, заявил, что современное масонство является единственным истинным реликвией веры патриархов до потопа, в то время как древние тайны Египта и других стран, которые так сильно напоминают его, были лишь человеческими искажениями одной изначальной и чистой традиции.

По мере развития научных и исторических знаний в разных областях исследований, особенно в критическом анализе Священного Писания, к изучению Масонства начали применяться научные методы. Сегодня у нас есть обширный объем довольно точной и весьма интересной информации о истории Ордена. В результате этих и других исследований, существуют четыре основных направления масонской мысли. Они не определяются или организуются как школы, но сгруппированы в соответствии с их связью с четырьмя важными областями знаний, в основном находящимися за пределами масонского поля. У каждого направления есть свой характерный подход к масонству; у каждого есть свои правила толкования масонских символов и ритуалов. Хотя ясно, что многие современные авторы находятся под влиянием более чем одного направления.

Аутентическое Направление

Сначала рассмотрим то, что иногда называют Аутентическое Направление, возникшее во второй половине девятнадцатого века в ответ на рост критического понимания в других областях. Старые традиции Ордена были тщательно изучены в свете достоверных записей, доступных историку. Огромное количество исследований было проведено на основе протоколов лож, документов всех видов, относящихся к прошлому и настоящему масонства, записей муниципалитетов и городов, законов и юридических актов. В общем, все доступные письменные записи были просмотрены и систематизированы. В этой области все масоны сильно обязаны Р. Ф. Гульду, великому историку масонства; В. Д. Хьюгану; Г. В. Спету; Дэвиду Мюррею-Лиону, историку шотландского масонства; доктору Четводу Краули, чья работа по ранней ирландской масонерии в своем роде классика; и другим членам Внутреннего Круга известной Ложи "Quattuor Coronati", № 2076, транзакции которой представляют собой ценный источник исторических и археологических знаний. В Германии два именитых имени - это И. Ф. Финдель, историк, и доктор Вильгельм Бегеман, проведший самые детальные и усердные исследования Старых Уставов оперативной масонерии. Благодаря усилиям ученых Аутентического Направления, студенты нашего Ордена сегодня имеют доступ к ценным материалам, которые останутся актуальными для изучения в будущем.

Эта школа обладает ограничениями, являющимися итогом её метода исследования. В столь секретном обществе как масонство, много важной информации никогда не записывали, а передавали устно в ложах. Поэтому документы и записи теряют значительную часть своего значения. Письменные архивы спекулятивного масонства практически не предшествуют его возрождению в 1717 году, в то время как самый ранний известный протокол заседания оперативной ложи относится к 1598 году* (^История ложи Эдинбурга, D. Murray-Lyon, c. 9.). Поэтому эта школа естественным образом связывает происхождение масонства с оперативными ложами и гильдиями Средневековья. Она предполагает, что спекулятивные элементы были добавлены позже к оперативной основе - это предположение не противоречит существующим записям. Брат R. F. Gould заявляет, что если мы принимаем символизм (или церемонии) масонства старше 1717 года, то мы можем допустить практически неограниченный возраст масонства* (^Краткая история масонства, R. R Gould, c. 55.), хотя многие другие авторы отыскивают истоки наших тайн только среди средневековых строителей.

В этой же школе существует тенденция, столь же естественная при данных исходных данных, отрицать действительность более высоких степеней и заявлять, согласно Торжественному Акту Объединения двух Великих лож масонов Англии в декабре 1813 года, что "чистое Древнее масонство состоит только из трех степеней и не более: Тех, кто вступил в ученики, ремесленников и мастеров, включая Верховный орден Святого Королевского арка."* (^Книга конституций, 1884, c. 16.) Все остальные степени и ритуалы считаются континентальными нововведениями и отвергаются как "ложное" масонство среди строго придерживающихся этой школы.

Что до трактовки знаков и символов масонства, эта школа преобладает морализаторским подходом, рассматривая их как дополнение к англиканскому христианству.

Школа Антропологии

Вторая школа, все еще находящаяся на стадии формирования, применяет открытия антропологии к изучению истории масонства, достигая похожих результатов. Антропологи собрали огромное количество информации о религиозных и инициаторских обычаях многих народов, как древних, так и современных. Масонские исследователи этой области обнаружили многие знаки и символы масонства, пользующиеся как рабочие, так и более высокие степени, в настенной живописи, резьбе, скульптуре и зданиях основных народов мира. Школа антропологии относит масонство к гораздо более древним эпохам, чем вообще смели это делать другие исследователи, и она находит заметные сходства с древними Мистериями многих наций, которые явно владели нашими знаками и символами, и вероятно применяли церемонии, аналогичные тем, что сегодня применяются в масонских ложах.

Антропологи не ограничиваются исследованием только прошлого, они также занимаются изучением обрядов посвящения многих существующих племён в Африке и Австралии и обнаружили, что эти племена используют знаки и жесты, которые до сих пор присутствуют среди масонов. Удивительные сходства с нашими масонскими ритуалами также были обнаружены среди населения Индии и Сирии, вплетённые в их религиозную философию таким образом, что идея о том, что они были скопированы из европейских источников, кажется абсолютно невозможной. Масонские учёные пока не могут представить полную картину всех открытий, которые могут быть совершены в этой наиболее интересной области исследований, но даже с нашими текущими знаниями, ясно, что обряды, схожие с теми, которые мы называем масонскими, являются одними из самых древних на Земле и их можно найти, в той или иной форме, практически во всех уголках мира. Наши символы есть в Египте и Мексике, в Китае и Индии, в Греции и Риме, на храмах Бирмы и соборах средневековой Европы, и существуют храмы в Южной Индии, где под строгими обещаниями передают те же тайны, которые передаются нам в ремесле и высоких степенях в современной Европе и Америке.

Среди первопроходцев в этой области следует упомянуть брата Альберта Черчварда, автора нескольких книг об египетском происхождении масонства, хотя возможно, он не всегда проявляет достаточную критичность; брата Дж. С. М. Уорда, автора "Масонство и древние боги", "Кто такой Хирам Абифф?" и других работ, который считает Сирию источником масонства, хотя он также собрал важную информацию из многих других земель; и Бернарда Спрингетта, автора "Тайные секты Сирии и Ливана", который собрал много материала по масонским ритуалам среди арабов.

Заслугой работы Антропологической Школы стало ясное осознание огромной древности и распространённости того, что сейчас называем масонской символикой. Однако, она также стремится найти истоки древних Таинств в обрядах посвящения диких племён, которые, хотя и обладают неоспоримой древностью, часто не отличаются достоинством или духовностью.

Другая важная работа, которую она сделала, - это обоснование того, что многие из высших степеней должны считаться "чисто древним масонством"; несмотря на провозглашение Великой Ложи Англии, у нас есть столько же свидетельств великой древности Роза-Креста, как и крафтовых и сводчатых знаков и символов, и то же самое можно сказать об знаках многих других степеней. Исходя из исследований антропологов, очевидно, что мы, масоны, являемся наследниками очень древней традиции, которая на протяжении несчётных веков была связана с самыми священными мистериями религиозного поклонения.

Мистическая Школа

Третья масонская школа, Мистическая, воспринимает тайны Мастерства с совершенно иной стороны, усматривая в них план духовного пробуждения и внутреннего развития человека. Учёные этой школы, опираясь на свои духовные переживания, утверждают, что степени Ордена символизируют определенные состояния сознания, которые должны пробудиться в посвященном, если он желает приобрести духовные сокровища. Они представляют свидетельства иной и более высокой природы об истинности наших масонских обрядов - свидетельств, относящихся скорее к религии, чем к науке. Цель мистика - сознательное единение с Богом, и для масона этой школы Ремесло показывает путь к этой цели, предлагая карту, так сказать, для направления поиска Бога.

Эти ученики часто больше заинтересованы в толковании, нежели в историческом исследовании. Они прежде всего стремятся следовать жизненному пути, обозначенному символами Ордена, чтобы достигнуть духовной реальности, тенями которой являются эти символы, а не вести линию наследия от прошлого. Тем не менее, они утверждают, что Масонство по крайней мере схоже с древними Мистериями, задачей которых также является показ пути, по которому человек может найти Бога; и они жалеют о том, что большинство наших современных братьев настолько забыли славу своего масонского наследия, что позволили древним обрядам стать пустыми формами. Оdsин из известных представителей этой школы - Брат А. Е. Вейт, нашец времен - один из заметных масонских ученых и специалист по истории высших степеней. Другой - Брат В. Л. Вильмшерст, автор глубоко духовных интерпретаций масонских символов. Эта школа делает многое для духовного обогащения мужского Масонства, что, безусловно, отражается в растущем уважении к нашим тайнам.

Тайная Школа

Четвертая школа мысля заметна среди студентов Ко-масонского Ордена и постепенно привлекает последователей и в мужской масонской традиции. Она основывается на принципе священной мощи масонского обряда, когда он проводится надлежащим и законным образом, что позволяет нам назвать эту школу Ритуалистической или Тайной. Термин "оккультизм" часто неправильно понимают; его можно определить как изучение и познание скрытой стороны природы с помощью способностей, которые присущи каждому человеку, но большинство из которых еще не пробуждены. Эти способности можно развить и обучить в оккультисте через долгую и основательную дисциплину и медитацию.

Цель оккультиста, не меньше цели мистика, - осознанное единение с Богом; но методы подхода отличаются. Оккультист старается достичь этого единения посредством знания и воли, тренируя всю свою природу - физическую, эмоциональную и умственную, до тех пор, пока она не станет идеальным воплощением внутреннего божественного духа и сможет служить эффективным инструментом в великом плане, который Бог создал для эволюции человечества, символизируемого в масонстве строительством священного храма. Мистик, напротив, стремится к экстатическому единению с тем уровнем божественного сознания, который допускает его текущая стадия эволюции.

Путь оккультиста лежит через серию постепенных шагов, ряд посвящений, дающих последовательное расширение сознания и степени священнодействующей силы; путь мистика часто бывает более индивидуальным, это "полет одиночки к Одиночеству", как прекрасно выразил это Плотин. Для оккультиста глубоко важно точное соблюдение формы, и с помощью церемониальной магии он создает способ, через который божественный свет может опуститься вниз и распространиться для помощи миру, призывая на помощь Ангелов, природные духи и других обитателей невидимых миров. Метод мистика проходит через молитву и орисон; он не заботится о формах, и хотя благодаря своему единению с ним он тоже становится каналом божественной Жизни, мне кажется, он теряет огромное преимущество коллективных усилий оккультиста, которые значительно усиливаются помощью высших Существ, чью помощь он призывает. Оба эти пути ведут к Богу; некоторые из нас непреодолимо привлекает первый, других - второй; в большей степени это вопрос Луча, к которому мы принадлежим. Один из путей более нацелен на служение и жертвоприношение, другой - на размышление и любовь.

Знание Оккультиста

Таким образом, ученик оккультизма учится пробуждать и тренировать скрытые в нем способности для их научного использования. По их помощи, он способен видеть намного больше реального смысла жизни, чем человек, восприятие которого ограничено физическими чувствами. Он осознает, что каждый человек в своей сущности божественен, является истинной искрой божественного огня, постепенно развивающейся к будущему славы и блеска, который достигает своего зенита в поединении с Богом. Метод его развития проходит через многократные спуски в земные оболочки для получения опыта и переходы в миры или плоскости невидимые физическим глазом. Он обнаруживает, что этот прогресс регулируются законом вечной справедливости, которая каждому человеку возвращает плод того, что он сеет: радость за добро и страдание за зло.

Он также узнает, что под волей T.M.H. миром управляет Братство Адептов, которые достигли божественного единения, но остаются на земле, чтобы направлять человечество; они основали все великие религии мира в соответствии с потребностями рас, для которых они были предназначены, и внутри этих религий создали школы Тайн, предлагающие тем, кто готов к более быстрому развитию, больше знаний и возможностей для служения. Этот Путь разделен на ступени и степени: испытательный Путь, или Нижние Тайны, где кандидаты готовятся к ученичеству, и собственно Путь, или Великие Тайны, в рамках которых в Великом Белом Ложе пройдены пять великих Посвящений, которые ведут ученика от земного бытия к жизни адепта в Боге, чтобы стать "живым пламенем", как говорится, "для освещения мира". Ему объясняют, что Бог, как во вселенной, так и в человеке, проявляется как Троица Мудрости, Силы и Красоты, и эти Три Аспекта представлены в Великом Белом Ложе в лицах его трех главных Офицеров, через которых великая сила Бога спускается к людям.

Оккультные Записи

Видно, что это оккультное знание зависит от изучения книг и записей не больше, чем от мистических переживаний; оба относятся к высшему порядку сознания, доказательство существования которого нельзя удовлетворительно продемонстрировать на физическом плане. Несмотря на это, изучение записей прошлого, оставленных на физическом плане, ценно для подтверждения исторических исследований подготовленного оккультиста, способного читать так называемые акашические записи и приобретать точные знания о прошлом. Эта тема так мало понятна, что, возможно, будет полезно, если я здесь приведу достаточно большое цитирование из книги под названием "Ясновидение", которую я написал много лет назад:

На ментальном плане (записи) имеют два в корне разных аспекта. Когда посетитель этого плана об этих запилях специально не думает, они просто создают фон для происходящего, как отражения в зеркале в конце комнаты могут создавать фон для жизни людей в ней. Нужно всегда помнить, что при этих условиях они являются лишь отражениями беспрерывной деятельности Великого Сознания на гораздо высшем плане...

Но если опытный исследователь особенно сфокусирует своё внимание на какой-либо сцене или захочет визуализировать её перед собой, происходит удивительное изменение, поскольку это план мыслей, и думать о чем-то значит мгновенно увидеть это перед собой. Например, если человек захочет увидеть запись о высадке Юлия Цезаря в Англии, он моментально окажется на берегу среди легионеров, со всей происходящей вокруг него сценой, точно так же, как если бы он стоял там на самом деле в то осеннее утро 55 года до нашей эры. Поскольку то, что он видит, есть лишь отражение, актеры, конечно, его не осознают, и он никакими своими усилиями не может изменить ход событий, исключая лишь способность контролировать скорость, с которой происходит действие - он может увидеть события целого года за один час или в любой момент остановить движение и заставить любую сцену остановиться и оставаться на виду как картину столько, сколько он захочет.

Верно, он воспринимает не только то, что мог бы увидеть находясь там во плоти, но и гораздо больше. Он слушает и понимает все, что говорят люди, и прознает все их мысли и мотивы; из многочисленных возможностей, которые открываются перед тем, кто научился читать записи, одной из наиболее интересных является изучение мысли давно минувших веков - мысли пещерных людей и обитателей озерных поселений, а также мысли, которые управляли великими цивилизациями Атлантиды, Египта или Халдеи. Можно легко представить, какие великолепные возможности открываются перед человеком, полностью обладающим этой силой. Перед ним поле исторических исследований наиболее увлекательного интереса. Он может в своем темпе пересмотреть всю историю, с которой мы знакомы, исправляя по мере изучения множество ошибок и заблуждений, затесавшихся в переданные нам счеты; он также может без препятствий бродить по всей истории мира с самого его начала, наблюдать за медленным развитием интеллекта у человека, спуск Повелителей Пламени и рост могучих цивилизаций, которые Они основали.

Но его исследование не ограничивается только развитием человечества; он видит перед собой, как в музее, все странные животные и растительные формы, которые населяли землю в дни, когда мир был молод; он может проследить все замечательные геологические изменения, которые произошли, и следить за ходом великих катаклизмов, вновь и вновь меняющих облик всей земли.

В одном частном случае даже более тесная связь с прошлым возможна для читателя записей. Если в ходе его исследований он должен взглянуть на сцену, где он сам участвовал в более ранней жизни, он может обращаться с ней двумя способами; он может рассматривать ее обычным образом, как зритель (хотя всегда, следует помнить, зритель с идеальным умением вникнуть и сочувствовать), или может вновь отождествлять себя с той давно умершим личностью - может вернуть себя на время в ту далекую жизнь и полностью пережить мысли и эмоции, удовольствия и страдания предысторического прошлого.

В свете этого оккультного знания (которое доступно внутреннему зрению) Масонство становится гораздо значительнее и священнее, чем обычно осознают его посвященные. Как всегда указывает на это традиция, оно оказывается прямым потомком Египетских Мистерий (когда-то сердцем той великолепной веры, чья мудрость и мощь были славой древнего мира - эти Мистерии были родителем и образцом тайных школ других соседних стран), и его целью по-прежнему является служить входом в настоящие Мистерии Великой Белой Ложи. Оно предлагает своим посвященным гораздо больше, чем простое проповедование морали при помощи строительных инструментов, хотя оно и "основано на самых чистых принципах благочестия и добродетели," так как без практики морали и ведения этичной жизни невозможно истинное духовное развитие.

Церемонии Масонства (по меньшей мере, те, что относятся к его высшим ступеням) можно считать драматизацией отрывков из невидимых миров, через которые кандидат должен пройти после смерти по естественному ходу вещей, а также теми, в которые он должен в полной осознанности вступить во время инициационных ритуалов истинных Тайн, отражение которых являет собой Масонство. Каждая степень имеет отношение к различным аспектам или плоскостям природы и содержит многоуровневое значение, применимое к сознанию T.G.A.O.T.U., конституции Вселенной и принципам, присущим человеку, согласно оккультному закону, сформулированному Гермесом Трисмегистом и принятым розенкрейцерами, алхимиками и изучающими Каббалу в более поздние эпохи: "Как вверху, так и внизу". Таким образом, масонские ритуалы являются ритуалами испытательного Пути, предназначенными подготовить Братьев к истинной Инициации и в полной мере открыть им знания настоящего Пути.

Священнодействие в Масонстве

Для изучающего оккультизм, Масонство также представляет собой аспект наивысшей важности, о котором я писал в "Скрытой жизни в Масонстве". Это не просто великолепная и сложная система оккультных символов, хранящая тайны невидимых миров - она также обладает священнодейством непередаваемой красоты и ценности как для ее инициатов, так и для всего мира в целом. Цель ритуала каждой степени - привлечь духовную силу, первоначально, чтобы помочь брату, на котором проводится степень, пробудить в себе тот аспект сознания, который соответствует символизму степени, настолько, насколько это возможно; во-вторых, чтобы способствовать эволюции присутствующих; и, самое главное, чтобы излить поток духовной силы, предназначенной для поднятия, укрепления и поддержки всех членов Общины.

Несколько лет назад я провел исследование скрытой стороны священнодействий Католической Церкви и опубликовал результаты этого исследования в книге "Наука Священнодействий". Те, кто читал эту книгу, помнят, что распространение духовной силы является одной из главных целей совершения Святого Евхариста и других церковных служб, и это достигается благодаря призыву Ангела построить духовный храм в внутренних мирах с помощью сил, генерируемых любовью и преданностью людям, а также наполнить этот храм огромной силой, вызванной во время посвящения Священных Элементов. Аналогичный результат достигается во время церемоний, проведенных в масонской Ложе, хотя их план отличается и, на самом деле, более древний; каждый из наших ритуалов, когда исполняется правильно, также строит храм в внутренних мирах, через который накапливается и излучается духовная сила, вызванная при инициации кандидата. Таким образом, Масонство воспринимается как "духовное зодчество", как в священном, так и в мистическом смысле, и каждая масонская Ложа должна быть каналом значительного значения для распространения духовного благословения в районе, где она работает.

Иногда ордена и ритуалы, которые однажды были источниками великой мощи, со временем принимали в свои ряды братьев, менее достойных прежних - братьев, которые больше заботились о собственной выгоде, чем о служении миру. В таких случаях, духовные силы, связанные с этими степенями, либо были полностью отозваны H.O.A.T.F.* (^См. "Скрытую Жизнь в Масонстве", стр. 15, 185.), для будущего внедрения в более подходящую группу, либо оставлялись в спячке до тех пор, пока не появлялись более подходящие кандидаты, способные достойно воплотить их. Преемственность продолжала передаваться, словно семена силы, хотя сама сила в основном оставалась подавленной.

С другой стороны, иногда ритуал или степень разрабатывались студентами, желающими выразить важную универсальную истину в церемониальной форме, но не обладающими глубокими знаниями тайных сторон масонства. Если такой ритуал или степень выполняли общественно полезную работу и привлекали подходящих кандидатов, то им иногда предоставлялись священнодействующие силы, подходящие для этого ритуала или степени. Это мог сделать некий брат на физическом уровне, который обладал одной из вышеупомянутых линий преемственности, и которую затем адаптировал H.O.A.T.F., или посредством прямого и нематериального вмешательства изнутри.

Более того, внутренний эффект определенной степени, даже в полностью действительном ритуале, может сильно варьироваться в зависимости от степени развития и общего отношения брата, которому она дарована. Так, скажем, 33 ° могут обещать ошеломляющую духовную силу в одном случае, а в другом, менее достойном, даруемые силы оказались бы значительно меньше из-за недостатка подходящего отклика кандидата. В таких ситуациях более полная степень мощи начинает проявляться по мере прогресса в развитии личности. Также, по-видимому, возможно временное отмена силы в случаях злодеяний одного из братьев, которую можно вновь предоставить, когда преступления прекратятся.

Все это может показаться сложным и запутанным тому, кто изучает форму Масонства. И это происходит потому что нашим физическим средствам сложно оценивать внутреннее влияние определенной степени без учета тех, кто ее практикует. Однако в общем, можно сказать, что ключевые направления масонской традиции - те, которые имеют наибольшую внутреннюю или духовную ценность - представляют степени Ремесленника. На этих степенях все остальные сосланы, заботясь о степенях Марки и Арки, а также о главных степенях Древнего и Принятого Шотландского Ритуала - 18°, 30° и 33°. Применяемые нами другие степени обладают своими особыми силами, которые часто бывают полезны. Но те степени, которые я упомянул, считаются наиболее ценными с точки зрения H.O.A.T.F. для сегодняшнего поколения и вот почему они практикуются сейчас в Ко-Масонском Ордене. Есть и другая интересная ветвь, которая существенно отличается от всех других степеней, существующих среди нас - это ритуалы Мемфиса и Мизраима. Заключающие в себе волшебные силы, хоть и не форму, эти ритуалы представляют, возможно, самые древние Тайны на Земле. Они, в свою очередь, играют свою роль в будущем, как и в прошлом, и поэтому нам они были сохранены и переданы в наши дни.

Форма и Жизнь

Во всех случаях мы должны помнить, что форма масонских степеней и их жизнь это два абсолютно разных явления, хотя в идеальной системе, как у древних Мистерий в сокровенные моменты их существования, эти понятия совпадали. Масонство сейчас находится в переходном состоянии, только начинает выпутываться из мрака Средневековья. В этого видно на примере ритуалов Мемфиса и Мизраима. Эти масштабные системы - 96° и 90° соответственно - представляют собой набор искусственно созданных церемоний; они ценны для масонского студента, разве что как исторический свидетель наивысших ступеней масонского творчества в Франции конца XVIII века. Большинство степеней обладают малой магической силой; Братья просто включили их в ритуалы, не имея представления о их истинном назначении. Однако, вне зависимости от формальной стороны традиции, линия после этого преемствования проходит из еще более древнего прошлого, чем сам Шотландский Ритуал. Даже в рамках Шотландского Ритуала существующие промежуточные степени обладают незначительной магической силой.

Ситуация будет восприниматься более полно, если мы осознаем, что план Масонства находится в руках H.O.A.T.F. Он управляет своим могучим Орденом с совершенной справедливостью и великолепным мастерством, делая все возможное для общего блага. За Масонством стоят великие и святые силы, которые должны быть переданы тем, кто заслужил их и будет относиться к ним со всем достоинством. Всегда и всюду на заднем плане присутствует великая и славная реальность, которая постоянно стремится к осуществлению и использует для своего проявления все доступные каналы. Все, что может быть использовано, используется в полной мере, и поэтому никто не может бояться того, что его пропустят. Очевидно, однако, что там, где Братья превалируют ради удовлетворения своего собственного тщеславия, больше, чем для Сокрытой Работы, там, где они проводят время за банкетами и покровительствуют праздничному шуму, сокращают священный ритуал, чтобы как можно скорее прийти к Югу, они менее достойные служения Божественной Славе, нежели духовные Братья, готовые к изучению и пониманию. Но всё время H.O.A.T.F. наблюдает. Он видит каждую попытку каждого мастера служить и Он излучает свою чудесную силу в той мере, в которой Братья сами её заслуживают.

Православие и Ересь

В связи с передачей масонских степеней возникает еще одна тема, которую мы подробнее разберем по мере изложения. Нужно осознать, что в масонском ритуале нет одной ортодоксии и многочисленных ересей и расколов. Скорее, есть столько линий традиции, как и способов передачи внутренней силы. Мистерии, проводящиеся в различных странах древнего мира, значительно отличались по своей форме и легендам, и следы этих различий остаются в тех ритуалах, которые мы сегодня используем. Многие равноправные линии традиции пересекались и переплетались в течение веков, и оказывали взаимное влияние друг на друга в большей или меньшей степени. Например, размещение главных офицеров в Мастерской ложе различается в английском и континентальном масонстве. Английское масонство следует старому египетскому способу их размещения, в то время как континентальное масонство следует халдейскому плану и размещает их в равностороннем треугольнике.

Силы продолжения строк I.M. в обеих системах по сути одни и те же, но так как в континентальных ложах церемония Инсталляции сводится к минимуму, передается только минимальная необходимая для фактической передачи степеней сила, и гораздо меньше делается для R.W.M. по сравнению с английским планом. Но это вопрос неполноты формы, а не отсутствия силы. Духовные силы за масонством работают через разные формы в зависимости от ценности формы и воли H.O.A.T.F., который является единственным судьей в долго обсуждаемом вопросе о разнице между настоящим и фальшивым масонством. В свете этого подхода к масонской преемственности, будет видно, что подлинные ритуалы - это те, которые обладают и передают духовную силу, в то время как фальшивое масонство - это работа с формой, из которой по тем или иным причинам была убрана жизнь, или к которой она никогда не была привязана.

В последующих главах я постараюсь проследить происхождение масонской традиции от Египетских Мisterii до наших дней, не пытаясь описать каждое звено в цепи преемственности, так как это займет всю жизнь и не принесет дополнительной пользы учащемуся, но сфокусируюсь на важных периодах масонской истории, открытых внутренним зрением и подтвержденных в сочинениях масонских ученых.

2 Египетские Мистерии

Сообщение Учителя Мира

В "Скрытой Жизни в Масонстве" я до некоторой степени описал форму и смысл масонства, как я его познал в Египте около шести тысяч лет назад. Эту форму, в значительной степени, обусловило рождение Учителя Мира среди египетского народа около 40,000 г. до н.э., когда он обучал их учению о Скрытом Свете. Было бы полезно кратко изложить историю нации с тех пор и до 13,500 г. до н.э., того момента, с которого я продолжил ее в предыдущей книге.

Истинная история Египта, как ее сегодня определяют ученые, начинается с Первой Династии, основанной Меною или Ману примерно в 5,000 г. до н.э. Даты разнятся от источника к источнику. Считается, что пирамиды в Гизе, которые играли важную роль в тайных аспектах египетского культа, были возведены королями Четвертой Династии, Хуфу (Хеопс), Хафра (Хефрен) и Менкаура (Микерин), в четвертом тысячелетии до н.э. Но внутренняя история Египта и его пирамиды ведет нас дальше назад, в эпоху, о которой даже традиции почти не говорят, хотя некоторые эхо правления божественных королей Атлантийской Династии, которые правили египетским царством тысячи лет, прослеживаются в египетских и греческих мифах о богах и полубогах, которые, как говорят, правили до прихода Ману.

Согласно Манетону, египетскому историку птолемейского периода, чьи работы сохранились лишь в отрывках, боги и полубоги правили 12,843 года. После них пришли Некии или Манес, которые, как говорится, правили 5,813 лет; возможно, некоторых из них можно уподобить Шемсу Херу, или Последователям Гора, о которых часто упоминают в египетских текстах.* (^Сэр E.A. Уоллис Бадж. Нил, стр. 26.) Диодор Сицилийский, который посетил Египет примерно в 57 г. до н.э., говорит, что по традиции считалось, что боги и герои правили Египтом немного меньше восемнадцати тысяч лет до времени Мены.* (^Диодор Сицилийский, История, Кн. I, xliv.) Нам известно больше о прошлом, благодаря книге "Человек: Откуда, Как и Куда", которая дает нам следующие факты.

Завоевание Египта атлантами произошло полтора столетия тысяч назад, а первая великая египетская империя продержалась до грандиозной катастрофы 75,025 года до н.э., когда большие острова Рута и Дайтья погрузились в океан, и остался лишь остров Посейдонис.* (^Op. cit., стр. 119 и 132, а также История Атлантиды, по Скотту Эллиоту.) В период господства этой империи были возведены три пирамиды, отражающие астрономические и математические знания атлантских священников;* (^См. Скрытую Жизнь в Масонстве, стр.229.) и именно к этой эпохе мы обращаемся за происхождением Таинств, переданных нам в ритуалах Масонства. Даже в те времена ритуалы были древними, следовательно, их источник необходимо искать в более отдаленном прошлом. В результате катастрофы 75,025 года до н. е. весь Египет был затоплен, и от всего его великольпия остались лишь три пирамиды, возвышающиеся над водами.* (^Человек: Откуда, Как и Куда, стр. 242 и 283.) После того как болота стали пригодными для жизни, наступило время возрождения под властью негроидов. А затем снова пришли атланты, восстановили великолепие египетских храмов и вновь установили скрытые Тайны, которые прежде отмечались в великой пирамиде. Это царство жило до времён аризации Египта в 13,500 год до н. э. Власть в империи осуществляла великая династия божественных королей, среди которых было множество героев, которых постеренно Греция считала полубогами, включая Геракла из двенадцати подвигов, легенда о котором дошла до классических времён.

Едва лишь 40,000 лет до н.э. к этим людям пришел Мировой Учитель из Белого Ложа, носивший имя Техути или Тота, которого позднее греки прозвали Гермесом. Он основал внешнюю обрядность египетских богов и восстановил былое величие Таинств.

Он прибыл, чтобы преподать великую доктрину «Внутреннего Света» жрецам Храмов, величественной церковной иерархии Египта, возглавляемой его Фараоном. Во внутреннем дворе главного храма Он наставлял их о «Свете, которым каждый входящий в мир освещается» - фразой Его, которая передавалась через века и нашла отражение в четвертом Евангелии в его изначально египетских фразах. Он учил их, что Свет универсален, и что тот Свет, который есть Бог, живет в сердце каждого человека: «Я - этот Свет,» - велел Он им повторять, - «Я этот Свет». «Этот Свет,» - сказал он, - «это истина о человеке, несмотря на то, признают его ли люди или пренебрегают им. Осирис - это Свет; Он родился из Света; Он живет в Свете; Он есть Свет. Везде скрывается Свет; он присутствует в каждом камне и в каждой скале. Когда человек становится единым с Осирисом, Светом, он становится единым со всем тем, что было частью его, и тогда он может увидеть Свет в каждом, как бы толстой не была покрывающая его оболочка, как бы глубоко он его не прятал и не сжимал. Все остальное не существует; но Свет существует. Свет - это жизнь людей. Для каждого человека, невзирая на то, как славны ритуалы и какие обязанности перепадают на долю жреца, а также сколько есть путей, по которым он может помочь людям, Свет ближе, он в самом его сердце. Реальность каждого человека ближе, чем любой ритуал, так как ему нужно лишь обратиться внутрь и тогда он увидит Свет. Это - цель любого ритуала, и ритуалы не должны исчезать, так как я пришел не нарушить, а исполнить. Когда человек осознает, он переходит ритуалы, он находит Осириса, проникает в Свет, в Свет Амен-Ра, источников всего сущего и конечного прибежища всего живого.

Осирис пребывает в небесах, но Осирис также живет в каждом сердце. Когда Осирис в сердце обретает Осириса в небесах, тогда человек становится Богом, и Осирис, когда-то разбитый на куски, снова становится цельным. Но видите: Божественный Дух Осириса, Вечная Матерь, Исида, дают жизнь Хору, являющемуся Человеком, рожденным обоими, но единым с Осирисом. Хор скрывается в Осирисе и Исида, была веществою, становится через него Королевой Жизни и Мудрости, и Осирис, Исида, и Хор все рождены от Света.

"Два рождения Хоруса. Он рождается от Исиды, Бога, воплотившегося в человеческую плоть, от Вечной Матери, материи, Вечной Девы. Он рождается вновь в Осирисе, искупляя долгий поиск Исиды за обломками тела своего мужа, разбросанными по земле. Хорус становится Осирисом, когда Осирис в сердце замечает Осириса в небесах и понимает, что они одно целое."

Так Он учил, и мудрые среди жрецов были довольны.

К Фараону, Монарху, Он дал лозунг: "Ищи Свет". Он сказал, что только тогда Монарх сможет правильно править, когда увидит Свет в сердце каждого. И народу Он дал лозунг: "Ты - Свет. Пусть твой Свет светит." Он выгравировал этот лозунг вокруг пилона в большом храме, вверх по одному столбу, через балку, вниз по другому столбу. Этот лозунг был выгравирован над дверями домов, и были сделаны миниатюрные модели пилона, на котором он его выгравировал, из драгоценных металлов и из обожженой глины, чтобы самые бедные могли купить маленькие модели из синей глины с коричневыми прожилками, покрытые глазурью. Другим любимым лозунгом стало: "Следуй за Светом", который позже стал: "Следуй за Королем", и распространился на запад, став лозунгом Круглого стола. И народ научился говорить о своих умерших: "Он ушел к Свету."

И радостная цивилизация Египта стала еще более радостной, потому что Он жил среди них как воплощенный Свет. Жрецы, которых Он обучил, передавали Его учения и секретные указания, которые они хранили в своих Тайнах, и студенты приходили со всех наций, чтобы учиться у мудрости Египта, и слава школ Египта дошла до всех земель.* (^Человек: откуда, как и куда, стр. 284-7.)

Боги Египта

Из вышеуказанного видно, что божества, или скорее формы Божественности, такие как Осирис, Исида и Хорус, были знакомы людям, а Мировой Учитель сделал своей задачей привлечение внимания к истинному значению этих трех Лиц. В каком времени знание об этих трех аспектах Бога было представлено в стране, мы не знаем, но к моменту нашего опыта они уже заняли свое место в символике Тайн.

Исида и Осирис

Исида, которой обычно приписывались Младшие Мистерии, была не только универсальной женской сущностью, отражённой в природе, но также реальным и важным Существом, подобно тому как Христос - это универсальная Жизнь, Второй Логос, и ещё высокопоставленный Чиновник Оккультной Иерархии. Благодаря своему высокому развитию и должности, Исида могла представлять перед человеком Женскую Сторону Божества. Исида была матерью всей живой плоти, источником мудрости, истины и силы; на её храме в Саисе было написано: “Я то, что есть, что было и что будет; и ни один человек до сих пор не лифтнул вуаль, скрывающую мою Божественность от смертных глаз.” (@Плутарх. Moralia; De Iside et Osiride.) Её символ - Луна; и влияние, которое она сыпала на своих последователей под звуки встряхиваемого систра, было изумрудного оттенка, приплетённого нежным серебром, что напоминало мерцание лунных лучей, от одного касания к которым наступал подъём и экстаз.

Осирис воплощал в себе Бога-Отца, проявившего себя в могучем Планетарном Духе. Его символом служило солнце, и потоки, которые он излучал, были пылающей славой света пронизанного золотом, наподобие лучей солнца, отражающихся от поверхности озера. Влияние Гора, который олицетворял Божественного Ребёнка, имело оттенок вечной любви, совершенной мудрости, окрашенный цветом розового золота.

ЖИВОТНЫЕ БОГИ

Египтяне также пребывали в рамках древней традиции уважения к отдельным животным, которые отражали различные аспекты божественности благодаря своим выдающимся качествам. Они выбирали у обезьяны разум, у ястреба - ясный взор, у быка - силу и т.д., приписывая эти качества определенным аспектам Божества. Расплодив отдельные животные как идеальных представителей своего вида, они отмечали их как символики этих божественных качеств. Так было с быками Апис и кошками Баст или Пашт. Эти животные не считались особо священными, но скорее, образцами качеств в бытовой форме. Сначала животное выступало лишь символом, но со временем египтяне те, что особо выделялись, связывали богами, и так были до определенной степени проявлениями божественности. Затем этих животных бальзамировали и их мумии укладывали в храмах, с намерением сохранения божественного влияния.

ПРАКТИКА БАЛЬЗАМИРОВАНИЯ

Аналогично, Фараона бальзамировали со стремлением сохранить его силу, связь с божественностью (которая была тесной, так как он был Фараоном), давая ей распространяться ещё долгое время после его смерти. Это напоминает более поздний обычай сохранения мощей святых. Глубокая любовь египтян к их стране диктовала ещё одну причину бальзамирования их мертвых; они стремились сохранить связь на физическом уровне, что могло привести их к перерождению среди своего народа. Во многих случаях это действительно происходило, хотя возможно, что в этом достаточно было и просто воли возвращающегося его. Однако привычка эта была не совсем хорошей, потому что если бальзамировать тело человека, привыкшего к злу, он после смерти получает больше силы; это позволяет ему легче материализоваться и вмешиваться в жизнь физического мира такими нехорошими способами. Нам повезло, что этот обычай не сохранился.

ДРУГИЕ БОЖЕСТВА

В древнем Египте, так же как и сегодня в Индии, почитались различные божества. В любом случае, обращения к Высшему получали ответ через выбранный верующим канал. Великие Ангелы разных Порядков и Лучей были назначены представлять эти разнообразные аспекты Божества и их почитали как богов в древних верованиях. Но связь настолько тесна, что обращение к одному из них одновременно являлось поклонением самому Богу. Шри Кришна, выступая в образе Верховного в Бхагавад Гите, говорит: "Даже те, кто поклоняются другим богам, исполненные верой и преданностью - они также поклоняются Мне."* (^Op. cit., ix, 23.)

Там, где поклонение происходит через определennую форму, можно быть уверенным, что за этой формой стоит Интеллект, который выступает медиатором или каналом между молящимся и Божеством за ним. Например, Хатор была богиней любви и красоты, а Изида - Королевой Истины и Матерью всего; обе они представляли женскую сторону Божества, так же как и Нефтида. Птах был Верховным Архитектором Вселенной, Святым Духом, которым был Творческий Огонь Бога; он был небесным мастером-металлургом, главным литейщиком и скульптором Богов, умелым Ремесленником, разработавшим конструкцию каждой части Вселенной.* (^Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, The Papyrus of Ani, p. 170.)

Братья Гора

Среди других божеств, тесно связанных с Тайнами, играющих важную роль во внутренней работе современных масонских церемоний, стоит упомянуть четырех сыновей или братьев Гора. Их изображают стоящими на лотосе перед троном Осириса в сцене Суда. Они представляют богов четырех сторон света, поддерживающих небесный свод на его четырех углах. Богом севера был Хапи, у которого была голова обезьяны; Богом востока - Туамутеф, с головой шакала; Амсет или Кеста правил югом, имея голову человека; Западом управлял Кебсеннуф, головой ястреба.* (^Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, The Nile, p. 267, Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life, p. 107.)

Глубокий интерес представляет изучение сути этих странных божеств внутренним взглядом, поскольку эта четверка совпадает с четырьмя девараджами Индии — королями элементов земли, воздуха, огня и воды, которые также властвуют над сторонами света. Они соответствуют херувимам, описаным Иезекиилем, и четырем зверям из Откровения. Святой Иоанн описывает их: 

В середине престола и круг вокруг престола, были четыре зверя, полные глаз спереди и сзади. Первый зверь был как лев, второй - как теленок, третий имел лицо человека, а четвертый был похож на летящего орла. У каждого из этих четырех зверей было шесть крыльев, и они были полны глаз внутри. Они не прекращали день и ночь восклицать: "Свят, свят, свят, Господь Бог Вседержитель, который был, есть и придет."* (^Откровение, iv, 6-8.)

Их крылья смыкались друг с другом; они не поворачивались при движении, каждый шел прямо вперед. Что касается их лиц, все четыре имели лицо человека и лицо льва с правой стороны, лицо быка с левой стороны; и все также имели лицо орла. Внешний вид живых созданий был подобен горящим углям, и как вид светлячков: он вздымался и опускался среди живых созданий; и огонь был ярок, и из огня выходили молнии. Рядом с живыми созданиями находилось колесо, каждое с четырьмя лицами. Внешний вид колес и их работа был подобен цвету алмаза: и у всех четырех была одна форма: их внешний вид и работа были как колесо внутри колеса. Когда они двигались, они двигались на своих четырех сторонах: и не поворачивались при движении. Что касается их колец, они были так высоки, что были страшны; и их кольца были полны глаз вокруг всех четырех.* (^Езекииль, I, 9, 10, 13, 15-18.)

Эта символика кажется странной; но она носит свой смысл, и любой исследователь, когда-либо имевший привилегию видеть огромные Четыре, сразу поймет, что и Св. Иоанн, и пророк Езекииль видели их тоже, как бы неавторитетны были их описания. Зверь с лицом человека заговорит о физическом теле (земля); бык или телец (как в случае быка Митры и быка Аписа) символизирует эмоциональное или астральное тело (вода); лев символизирует волю и ум (воздух); и летящий орел указывает на духовную природу человека (огонь). Египетские формы немного отличались; но в них отражены те же четыре элемента и их властители, которые мы находим во всех религиях. Существует четырехлицевой Брама; есть четырехсторонний Юпитер, выступающий в роли того, которые обладает воздухом, молнией, морем и землей. И это ведет нас обратно к реальности, скрытой за всеми этими символами, к четырем великим Ангел-властителям элементов, исполнителям великого закона, который являются богами или лидерами иерархии Ангелов земли, воды, воздуха и огня. Это - таинственные четыре; и они полны глаз внутри, потому что они являются писцами, записывающими, служителями Липики: они ставят на вид все, что происходит, все, что действуется, все, что записано или произнесено или мыслится во всех мирах.

В "Свете Азии" их изображают как Правителей четырёх сторон света:

...четыре Правителя Земли, слезшие 
С горы Сумеру - те, кто записывают деяния людей
На бронзовые плиты - Ангел Востока,
Войска которого одеты в серебряные одеяния и держат
Щиты из жемчуга: Ангел Юга,
Всадники которого, Кумбханды, ездят на синих скакунах,
Со щитами из сапфира: Ангел Запада,
Сопровождаемый Нагами, ездящими на кроваво-красных конях,
С коралловыми щитами: Ангел Севера,
Окружённый его Якшами, все в золоте,
На жёлтых конях, несущих золотые щиты.

Это поэзия с сильно выраженным ориентальным окрасом, но у неё есть укреплённое основание. Её форма, в которой она отлита, очевидно, просто традиционна; но всегда за ней сокрыт факт. Эти Великие Одушевлённые существа окружены, и в постоянной связи с, огромными войсками Ангелов и помощников, но эти войска не принимают форму конвоя всадников; однако цвета отдельных войск приведены правильно. Эти четыре самые странные и чудесные существа не именно Ангелы, в обычном понимании слова, хотя они часто так называются; под ними находятся иерархии ангелов, которые осуществляют их волю согласно Закону, ведь они возглавляют огромную машину божественной справедливости, и в их руках лежит выполнение закона кармы. Иногда их называют сторожами, которые охраняют ворота, проверяя материал для строительства священного храма.

Освящение

Эти существа очень тесно связаны с внутренней работой Таинств, и, следовательно, Масонства, которое происходит из них. Они представляют собой большие строительные силы вселенной, конструктивные мощи природы; и так как в наших Ложах мы заняты строительством вселенной в миниатюре, мы обращаемся к ни кто другому, как к ним, за помощью в нашей работе. Это обращение производится при освящении каждой Ложи, какой бы мало власти у современного освящающего офицера, даже не зная о чём он на самом деле делает, когда обильно посыпает традиционные приношения кукурузы, вина, оливкового масла и соли, символы которых были выбраны ими из незапамятных времен, чтобы представлять свои особые мощи. Этот древний ритуал, когда его применяет И.М. должным образом уполномоченный на освящение Ложи, приносит великие результаты в внутренних мирах; поскольку это призыв к планетарным духам, которые возглавляют четыре линии, признать новую Ложу и посвятить её служению T.G.A.O.T.U.

Зов не остается без ответа. Когда зерно рассеивается на севере, обители земли, великолепный золотой Ангел, спускается во всем своем величии, за ним следуют его сокровища, некоторые из которых остаются, чтобы стать проводниками мощи его иерархии всякий раз, когда Ложа ритуально открывается. Выпитое вино на юге привлекает великого синего Ангела воды, сопровождаемого другими меньшими Ангелами. Аналогично, подношение масла на западе вызывает могущественного малинового Ангела огня, который проливает в Ложу величественную ритмическую Силу, "самую ужасную и прекрасную" из стихий. Когда соли распыляются на востоке, Ангел воздуха стремительно и с молниеносной скоростью спускается с небес, он и его слуги имеют чудесную серебристую окраску, пронизанную матовыми оттенками жемчуга. Эти четыре Обители, представляющие четырех богов элементов, четырех детей или братьев Гора, торжественно посвящают Ложу, объединяя Братьев в тесный союз во внутренних мирах и связывая их с Ангелами их рангов, которые будут их представлять на каждом собрании Ложи. Традиция этих четверых досталась Средневековым ремесленникам и смешалась с традицией четырех коронованных мучеников, покровителей Ремесла.

Я хотел бы предупредить своих Братьев, которые могут быть привлечены к роли освящающих офицеров, чтобы убедились, что для церемонии im используют зерно - именно пшеницу, а не кукурузу. Однажды, по ошибке мне была предложена кукуруза (которую в Америке называют "индейка") и, так как времени на получение пшеницы не было, я вынужден был использовать то, что мне предложили. Результат меня неприятно удивил: появились духи природы абсолютно иного рода, они не знали, что им предстоит сделать, и они были совершенно неподходящими для этого. Я был вынужден повторить эту часть обряда позже, уже с подходящим материалом.

Цель Мистерий

В "Скрытой жизни в масонстве" я уже кратко упоминал о намерении Мистерий.* (^Сс. op. cit., стр. 34.) Я сказал:

Мистерии были видными общественными учреждениями, поддерживаемыми государством, центрами национальной и религиозной жизни, куда сотни людей из высших слоев спешат оставить свой след; они выполняли свою работу превосходно, потому что тот, кто прошел их степени - процесс, занимающий многие годы - становился тем, что мы сейчас называем высокообразованным и культурным мужчиной или женщиной, с, помимо его знаниями этого мира, видное восприятие будущего после смерти, места человека в системе вещей и, следовательно, то, что действительно стоит делать и для чего стоит жить.

Следовательно, не стоит думать, что Мистерии были тайными обществами, всеми своими делами специально скрытыми от обычной публики. Вскоре станет ясно, что тысячи людей присоединились к обычным степеням Исиды. Обучение и обучение внутренних и высших степеней (как мы их называем) были наверняка скрыты от тех, кому они не были адресованы, то есть от тех, кто не был достаточно развиты для того, чтобы принимать в них участие, но только так же, как в современном университете занятия, на которых, допустим, преподаются конические сечения, закрыты для детей, которые всё ещё учат простую арифметику.

Все в Египте знали о Мистериях, и большинство понимало, что они в основном связаны с жизнью после смерти и подготовкой к ней. Это учение, однако, передавалось инициаторам Мистерий под строгими и обязывающими заверениями о секретности, и показывали в подробностях результаты определённых линий действий в мире после смерти. Основные моменты этого секретного обучения были включены в тайные обряды Инициации, Перехода и Поднятия, и часть этих обрядов дошла до нас в виде ритуалов Фримасонства, которые до сих пор защищены тайными клятвами, как в старину.

В каждой великой нации были свои Мистерии, через которые великие Учителя человечества пытались обучить народ важным вещам, вдохновляемые Великой Белой Ложей, которая стоит за всеми религиями. Среди всех Мистерий египетские были самыми знаменитыми среди западных народов древнего мира, не только из-за их древности, но и потому что Египет был одним из помощников Белой Ложи. Великое Белое Братство имеет свою штаб-квартиру в Центральной Азии, но в разное время и по разным причинам поддерживало подразделения в разных частях мира.

Нахождение этого тайного центра Белого Братства в Египте во многом способствовало его величию на протяжении веков. Несмотря на то, что его существование не было известно внешнему миру, эта Ложа истинных Мистерий контролировать всю схему египетской инициации и сделала её образцом для Мистерий других народов. Так Египет стал центром духовного просвещения для всего западного мира, и все искавшие Инициаций были привлечены к нему; и это объясняет почтение, которое учёные греки позже проявили к египетским Мистериям.

Основным местом для публичной работы этих Мистерий была великая пирамида, которую в древнем Египте называли Хут, "Свет". Её построили на основе самых точных астрономических и математических расчётов, и она служила ключом к загадкам вселенной, вырезанным в камне. * (^Смотрите "Скрытая жизнь во Фримасонстве", стр. 228-30.)

Инициаторы египетских Мистерий символически принимали участие в строительстве пирамиды, как и мы, современные масоны, строим храм царя Соломона. Оба этих здания предназначены для символизации процессов строительства природы. В залах под пирамидой - тех подземных помещениях, о которых упоминал Геродот* (^Гер. Книга II, 124.) - проводились некоторые церемонии Мистерий. Эти и другие залы внутри и вокруг великой пирамиды до сих пор неизвестны исследователям, однако они могут быть открыты "по секрету" - секретные двери, вращающиеся на оси благодаря сложной системе противовесов, открываются при наступании на определённые места на полу в определённом порядке.

Церемонии Тайн также предназначены для изображения более высокого эволюционирования человека, его возврата к божественному источнику, откуда он происходит, через развитие высшей его природы. Это происходит не только благодаря практикам медитации и церемониальным действиям, но даже более на основе применения этических прецептов, которые были преподаны. Многие люди наших дней представляют, что мы знаем этические истины, не подвергаясь обучению, но это не так; они кажутся нам совершенно естественными сейчас, но давным-давно они были открытиями или откровениями, нечто аналогичное шагам прогресса в материальной науке и изобретательстве.

Каждая степень Тайн создавалась, чтобы отражать те или иные великие Посвящения Белого Лоджа, так что инициированные на этом низшем уровне могли в конечном итоге подготовить себя к вступлению на Путь Святости и стремиться достичь полноты единения с Осирисом, Спрятанным Светом. Когда мы придём к изучению этих степеней, мы увидим, как было упорядочено это учение, и как те инициированные, кто должным образом подготовился, были в состоянии достичь истинного знания, которое они искали. Вся система инициации давала полную карту духовного эволюции человека, и было делом каждого отдельного кандидата стараться внедрить учение в практику и осознать в своем сознании то, что было символизировано в ритуале.

Степени Тайн

Тайны Египта, как всегда, подразделялись на два основных раздела: меньшие и большие. Меньшие Тайны до некоторой степени представляют то, что мы теперь знаем как Первую Степень Ремесленной Масонии, в то время как Большие Тайны аналогичны тем, что мы сейчас называем Второй и Третьей Степенями. Выше этих была церемония, соответствующая степени I.M., в которой власть хранится и передается из века в век; и еще выше были духовные силы большего размера, указанные и в некоторой мере даны в выполнении старших ступеней Древнего и Принятого Шотландского Обряда. За всей системой масонских посвящений стоял (и стоит) сам Белый Лодж, дарующий пять больших Посвящений, которые ведут к человеческому совершенству и полному единству с Богом.

Тайны Исиды

В меньших Тайнах инициированному учат, что лежит по ту сторону смерти, и церемония инициации является символической картой того промежуточного мира, который иногда называют астральным планом. Возможно, Апулейсукказывает на эту степень, когда описывает Тайны Исиды, проходящие в Греции во втором веке нашей эры, хотя он писал во время, когда они уже упали в значительное упадничество. После упоминания о различных типах очистительных процессов, которые он претерпел, он продолжает описывать некоторые аспекты того, что происходило во время его инициации:

Тогда, вот, подошел день, когда должно было осуществиться священнодействие посвящения; и когда солнце склонилось и наступил вечер, с каждого берега прибыло большое количество священников, которые в соответствии со своим древним обрядом предложили мне множество подарков и даров. Тогда всю прочую, непосвященную люд принудили уйти, и когда на мою спину надели новую льняную робу, священник взял меня за руку и привел к самому таинственному и священному месту храма. Ты, увлеченный читатель, возможно, хочешь знать, что сказали и сделали там: воистину, я бы рассказал тебе, если бы мне было разрешено говорить, ты бы узнал, если бы было разрешено тебе слышать; но оба твои уши и мой язык столкнулись бы с одним и тем же страданием от непомерного любопытства. Однако я не буду долго мучить твой ум, который, возможно, немного религиозен и склонен к некоторому почитанию; послушай поэтому, и верь в это, как в истину. Знай, что я приблизился к аду, да к вратам Прозерпины, и после того как был охвачен всеми элементами, я вернулся на свое место: около полуночи я увидел ярко светящееся солнце, увидел также небесных и адских богов, перед которыми я представился и поклонился. Вот, я рассказал тебе, что, хотя ты и слышал, тем не менее, необходимо скрыть; поэтому я скажу только то, что можно высказать без оскорбления для понимания непосвященных.

Когда настало утро и торжества завершились, я вышел, освященный с десятью таларами и в религиозной одежде, о которой мне не запрещено говорить, учитывая, что меня видели многие люди. Мне приказали стать на деревянный трибун, который стоял посреди храма, перед образом и значением богини; моя одежда была из тонкого льна, украшенного и вышитого цветами; на моих плечах была драгоценная геральдика, окутывающая меня сзади до земли, на которой были изображены звери разных цветов, такие как индийские драконы и гиперборейские грифоны, которых в виде птиц рождает другая часть мира: священники обычно называют такую одежду Олимпийским стефаном. В моей правой руке я держал зажженный факел, и на моей голове был венок из цветов с белыми пальмовыми листьями, которые простирались со всех сторон, как лучи; так я был украшен, подобно солнцу, и сделан в виде изображения, если ткань была откинута и все люди собрались чтобы на меня посмотреть. Тогда начался праздник, празднование моего священного порядка, с пышными банкетами и приятной пищей: на третий также гуляли с подобными церемониями, с религиозной вечерей и всеми ритуалами посвящения.

Также сообщается, что во время церемонии Исида сказала:

Я - Природа, родитель всего, владыка элементов, первородное отпрыск времени.

Предварительные испытания

Секреты, сообщенные в Тайных обрядах, были хорошо и лояльно сохранены, и доступных подробностей о них нет, хотя мы иногда находим осторожные намеки, которые дают нам некоторое представление о их характере. Есть живописное описание подготовки к ним, данное в "Лексиконе Масонства" Макея, которое, хотя оно не подтверждает собой записей, сохраненных греческими и римскими авторами, тем не менее содержит некоторые отрывки истины. Я беру на себя смелость его сократить следующим образом:

За несколько дней до посвящения от кандидата ожидали сохранения полного воздержания, соблюдения растительной диеты и очищения себя через многократные ритуальные омовения. Когда наступало время, его приводили в полночь к входу низкого прохода, где он должен был перемещаться на руках и коленях. В конечном итоге, он подходил к отверстию колодца, в который его просили спуститься. Если проявлялся хоть малейший намек на сомнения, его возвращали назад в внешний мир, лишая возможности быть кандидатом на посвящение. Однако, если он решался на спуск, проводник показывал ему скрытую лестницу, которая позволяла безопасно спуститься. После этого они входили в узкий и извилистый коридор, у входа в который была выгравирована надпись: "Смертный, который пройдет этот путь без колебаний и оглядок назад, будет очищен огнем, водой и воздухом, и если ему удастся победить страх смерти, он вновь увидит свет и обретет право подготовить свою душу для приема Тайн великой богини Исиды."

Проводник затем покидал искателя, предупреждая о предстоящих опасностях и говоря, чтобы он оставался безмятежным. Тяжелые двери шли за ним, делая возвращение невозможным. Вскоре кандидат приходил в большой зал, наполненный огнем, который он должен был перебежать с максимальной скоростью. Преодолев этот огненный переход, он находил себя в другом зале, где пол был усеян горящими железными плитами с минимальными пространствами между ними. Спустя это испытание он добирался до широкого и быстрого водоотвода, через который должен был проплыть. На другой стороне его ждал узкий проем, окруженный двумя высокими латунными стенами, в каждой из которых находилось колесо из того же материала. За ними были двери из слоновой кости. Несмотря на отсутствие способа открыть эту дверь, он вскоре обнаружил большие кольца, которыми попытался повернуть, только для того, чтобы вызвать вращение латунных колес с оглушающим шумом и вызвать падение платформы под ним, оставив его висящим на кольцах над, казалось бы, бездонной пропастью, где холодный ветер задувал пламя его светильника и оставлял его в полной темноте. Было лишь недолгое время, до того как шум прекратился, платформа вернулась на свое место и двери из слоновой кости открылись. Через них он входил в ярко освещенный кабинет, где он встретился с рядом священников Исиды, одетых в мистическую символику их должностей, которые приветствовали и поздравляли его. На стенах он обратил внимание на различные символы Египетских Тайн, значения которых ему постепенно объясняли.

Все подробности такой истории гарантировать невозможно, но вполне верно, что суровые испытания, аналогичные описанным, проводились с кандидатами на внутренние Мистерии. Никакие из этих испытаний не предполагались для человека, который желал пройти только обычный курс интенсивного обучения; он мог пройти через Меньшие и Большие степени, столкнувшись лишь с тяжелыми и долгими учебными заданиями; и он бы никогда даже не узнал, что есть еще одна стадия (или скорее ряд стадий) которые находятся за пределами этих, где он столкнется с такими серьезными астральными опасностями, что необходимо было сначала подвергнуть кандидата суровым испытаниям его мужества и самоконтроля.

В начале эпохи Тайн жрецы воплощали в жизнь реалистичные сцены перед кандидатом, благодаря чему он мог увидеть, что ожидало его после смерти. Позже, когда знания иерофантов иссякли, кандидату показывали сложные механические устройства, которые так или иначе отражали реалии астрального мира. Ещё позже, эти картины воспроизводились посредством символических церемоний, основные черты которых мы можем видеть сегодня в инициационной церемонии масонства, хотя в некоторых Обедиенциях сохранился лишь фрагмент первоначального ритуала.

Таинственный Язык

Помимо уроков о жизни после смерти - которые проявлялись через бесчисленные истории о вымышленных персонажах, показывающих возможные последствия жизненных действий в астральном мире после смерти - инициатам Первой степени также преподавали широкий курс образования. Этот курс включал то, что масоны назвали семью свободными искусствами и науками: грамматикой, логикой, риторикой, арифметикой, геометрией, музыкой и астрономией. Под грамматикой египтяне подразумевали священное иероглифическое письмо жрецов, которым обучали всех инициатов, но это также означало особый, секретный язык - язык жрецов. В этом таинственном языке не столько использовались новые слова, сколько привычные слова приобретали новые значения.

В древнем Египте мы смогли разговаривать о тайнах внутренней жизни перед толпой, не выдавая наше истинное намерение; у нас был обширный словарь важных слов, так что разговор мог выглядеть как повседневный, в то время как на самом деле касался тайн Тайн. Много уроков давались именно таким образом; публичная лекция или речь одного из жрецов могла иметь два абсолютно различных значения - этические для помощи непосвященным и эзотерические для учеников Тайн. Легенда о том, что у масонов есть универсальный язык, известный только Братьям, возможно, является эхом традиции об этом древнем и секретном языке.

Секретный язык Инициаций использовался также для надписей, на иероглифических стенных росписях и папирусах. Многие из этих надписей, повествующих о победах великих фараонов, можно было прочитать, улавливая скрытый смысл, и тогда они передавали духовные уроки тем, кто знал их истинное значение. Это, безусловно, относится к Книге Мертвых, которая в переводе на английский язык современными учеными часто представляется непонятной и даже гротескной. Однако в интерпретации, данной в Тайнах, эти тексты непрерывно озаряются внутренним светом и сообщают массу информации о реалиях жизни и смерти.

Возможно, стоит снова отметить, что жрецы не желали обманывать людей. Они лишь стремились давать обучение, соответствующее возможностям слушателя, и ограждать важные секреты от неподготовленных к их осознанию. Именно поэтому было усложнено внутреннее устройство Великой пирамиды. Некоторые проходы совсем не использовались в плане посвящения, так как истинный путь был доступен совершенно иным путем. Эта политика была обусловлена мудростью. Разве не хорошо было бы, если бы в наши дни мы смогли бы придумать способ, с помощью которого новые научные открытия (теперь используемые для вреда и разрушения) могли бы сохраняться только для использования людьми, которые наверняка используют их во благо общества?

Двойственность Каждой Степени

Обычные Меньшие Тайны (или первая степень) были доступны всем, кто искал посвящения, при условии, что они вели добродетельную жизнь, обладали разумом, были свободны, и что о t … o … g … r … говорится положительно. Они постепенно переходили к Большим Тайнам (Второй и Третьей Степени). Но в каждой из этих степеней существовали и внутренние тайны, о которых я уже упоминал в связи с первичными испытаниями.

Внутренние Тайны Исиды

В глубине внешних тайн Исиды существовали внутренние круги учеников, тщательно отобранных жрецами. Наличие этих кругов оставалось строго секретным даже для большинства инициированных. В этих кругах давались практические оккультные занятия, помогающие ученику пробуждать и развивать свои внутренние способности, чтобы он мог изучать условия астрального плана из первых рук и самостоятельно познавать то, что для большинства Brn оставалось лишь теорией. Строгие испытания, о которых я уже упоминал, проходили только в этих кругах, и здесь кандидат получал индивидуальное обучение в подготовке к более великим и священным Тайнам, что являются основой всего египетского посвящения.

Кандидат, стремящийся пройти эти внутренние испытания, сначала должен был принять очищающую ванну (отсюда пошла идея христианского крещения), а затем облачиться в белую одежду, символизирующую предстоящую чистоту души, прежде чем быть приведенным перед советом священноиницированных в особой комнате или пещере. Сначала его тщательно проверяли на развитие ясновидящих способностей, которые ему было ранее предписано пробудить; для этого кандидат должен был прочитать надпись на бронзовом щите, пустая сторона которого обращалась к его физическому зрению. Позднее его оставляли в одиночестве для ночного дежурства; ему были переданы определенные мантры, или слова силы, призванные контролировать определенные виды сущностей; во время его дежурства перед ним проецировались различные образы, некоторые из которых были страшными, а некоторые - соблазняющими, чтобы проверить, сохранится ли его храбрость и спокойствие. Он поочередно отгонял все эти образы с помощью своего уникального знака и слова; но в конце все они исчезали, и на последнем этапе инструктировали его использовать могущественное слово силы, которым можно победить все возможное зло. Такой подход к обучению был предложен тем кандидатам, которых священники считали подходящими, чтобы в конце обучения они полностью прониклись знанием астрального мира и могли с легкостью управлять его силами в состоянии бодрствования.

Тайны Сераписа

Вторая ступень египетских мистерий в некотором роде соответствует нашей степени F.C.; их называли Великими Мистериями или в более позднее время - Мистериями Сераписа. Апулей почти ничего не говорит по этому поводу, кроме того, что он прошел эту степень. Обучение в Великих Мистериях углублялось в отношении науки и философии; студентам предлагался более сложный курс интеллектуального обучения, который можно назвать исследованием "тайных троп познания Природы и Науки". В то же время изучение жизни после смерти расширялось для включения в небесный мир, m … c … , куда все должны уйти, чтобы получить отдачу за добрые дела, совершенные на земле; большая часть этого глубокого познания ментальной плоскости была представлена в Великих Мистериях, точно так же, как факты об астральной жизни были изложены в Первой Ступени, то есть, с помощью репрезентации и драматизации. Цель Мистерий Сераписа в жизни инициированного человека была укрощением разума* (^См. Скрытая жизнь в Масонстве, гл. vii.) и тренировкой ментального тела; и священнодействия, вызываемые церемониалом, были направлены на ускорение этого ментального развития.

Внутренняя Степень Сераписа

За внешними мистериями этой ступени скрывались также тайные круги, совершенно не доступные для тех, кто не проходил внутренние испытания Первой ступени; здесь давали практические уроки по развитию ментального тела и методику пробуждения точного видения на ментальной плоскости, так чтобы студент мог самостоятельно проверять учения священников.

Диодор пишет следующее:

В древние времена, согласно сложившейся традиции, священники тщательно хранили тайну об обстоятельствах смерти Осириса. Однако впоследствии из-за необдуманности некоторых, то, что некогда молчаливо охранялось среди немногих, стало известно многим. (^Diod, Sic. Hist. Bk. i, xxi.)

Легенда Об Осирисе

Наилучшее доступное для нас исчерпывающее изложение этой легенды сохранилось благодаря Плутарху в его трактате "Об Исиде и Осирисе", написанном на греческом языке около середины первого столетия нашей эры. Большая часть этого трактата подтверждена текстами египетских иероглифов, которые были расшифрованы учеными. Его содержание можно вкратце изложить следующим образом:

Осирис был мудрым царем в Египте, ставшим целью цивилизовать свой народ и лишить его варварства, свойственного его прежнему состоянию. Осирис обучил свой народ земледелию, принял набор законов и провел религиозное образование в духе почитания богов. После того как свое королевство он привел в состояние процветания, Осирис отправился учить цивилизации другие народы мира. Во время его путешествий его супруга Изида столь мудро управляла Египтом, что его завистливый брат Тифон (Сет) - воплощение зла, как и Осирис воплощение добра, - не мог причинить вред его королевству. Но с возвращением Осириса в Египет, Тифон устроил заговор против него. Он подстрекнул присоединиться к заговору семьдесят двух человек, а также королеву Эфиопии по имени Асо, которая случайно оказалась в Египте в то время. Тифон втайне измерил тело Осириса и приказал создать прекрасный сундук тех же размеров. Он принес его на вечеринку, когда Осирис был среди гостей, и обещал, как бы шутя, подарить его кому-то, кого этот сундук идеально укладывает.

Все собравшиеся на празднике примеряли этот сундук на размер, но никому он не подошел. В конце концов Осирис сам лег в него, после чего заговорщики незамедлительно закрыли и запечатали сундук свинцом, после чего бросили его в Нил. Говорят, что убийство Осириса произошло на семнадцатый день месяца Афир (Хатор), когда солнце находилось в знаке Скорпиона, а Осирис прожил двадцать восемь лет, будь то его возраст или период правления. (Стоит отметить, что эта дата отмечает начало зимы, когда солнце мистически умирает под властью теней; и именно в этот день, совпадающий с праздником Всех Душ в христианской церкви, Египет оплакивал смерть Осириса, как мы оплакиваем смерть тела Иисуса в Великую пятницу.)

Исида в Коптосе узнала о трагедии. Она отстригла прядь своих волос, одела траурную одежду и отправилась на поиски тела Осириса. Она узнала, что сундук с его телом унесло море в Библ - не в сирийский Библ, а в папирусные болота дельты* (^Сэр Э. А. Уоллис Бадж, "Египетские идеи о будущей жизни", стр. 48 - сноска). Сундук запутался в кроне дерева тамарикса, которое так обросло вокруг него, что ничего не было видно. Удивленный необычным размером дерева, король страны спилил его и изготовил из него столб, поддерживающий крышу его дворца. Исида отправилась в Библ и стала няней у одного из сыновей короля. Каждую ночь она помещала ребенка в огонь, чтобы изгнать его смертные части, обращаясь в ласточку и оплакивая потерю мужа. Однако королева увидела своего ребенка в огне и закричала от страха, лишив его возможности стать бессмертным. Богиня раскрыла свою истинную сущность и попросила столб, поддерживающий крышу. Она получила его, извлекла из него сундук с телом Осириса и вернулась с ним в Египет. Она спрятала его, пока искала своего сына Хора. Но Тифон, охотясь при свете луны, нашел сундук, узнал в нем тело Осириса, разорвал его на четырнадцать кусков и разбросал по всей земле. Исида, узнав об этом, сделала лодку из папируса и отправилась собирать части тела. Вернувшись из потустороннего мира, Осирис явился своему сыну Хору и приказал ему сразиться с Тифоном. Битва длилась много дней, но в конце концов Хор одержал победу. Наконец, Осирис стал царем подземного мира и судьей мертвых.

Эта история, как и наша собственная традиционная история, пострадала от материалистических вбросов тех, кто ее не понимал. В рассказе Плутарха нет ясного упоминания о воскрешении, а всего лишь намеки на возвращение из мертвых. Это, однако, очень позднее изложение традиции, искаженное до неузнаваемости. В Мистериях Осириса эта легенда была ближе к истинным духовным законам. Даже разгаданные египетские надписи явно упоминают воскрешение. Основной ход истинной легенды - это гибель Осириса от рук Сета, разделение его тела на дважды семь частей, представляющих проявления семи лучей после спуска Логоса в материю; поиск Исидой и найденные обломки тела, их объединение и в конце воскрешение Осириса в триумфальное бессмертие и вечное воскресение.

На этом этапе также изучалась функция Осириса как судьи мертвых и весы сердца Ани перед лицом суда Осириса соответствуют суду души Владыками Кармы. Если душа была чистой, она могла перейти к бессмертию; если она говорила ложью, она была отдана на волю монстру Амемиту, "пожирателю", и втягивалась обратно в цикл воплощений, чтобы родиться снова в новом теле. Хотя эти символы и легенды были известны всему миру, их истинное значение открывалось только посвященным третьей степени.

Смысл Истории

Часто думают, что история Осириса, как и истории Митры и других солнечных богов (в том числе и Христа), это просто апофеоз процессов природы, знакомых земледельческому народу. Плутарх говорил, что Осирис - это река Нил, а Исида - земля Египта, периодически оплодотворяемая его разливами.* (^Плутарх. Моралии; "Об Исиде и Осирисе.") Астрономически, Осирис - это Солнце, Исида - Луна, а Тифон - тьма и зима, которые в своем торжестве уничтожают плодородие Солнца и мешают ему даровать жизнь миру. Это универсальная история о боге-солнце.

Тот, кто после борьбы за существование и развития своей силы в начале года, в конце концов, поднимается в зените своей славы, дарует жизнь всем существам, спелея зерно и виноград, только чтобы снова отступить перед зимой.

Солнце на небе, как великая жизнь мира, следует этому циклу смерти и воскрешения; и малая жизнь в зерне проходит похожий процесс - оно прорастает и приносит плод, который собирают и жертвуют для питания человека и других существ; но так же как Тифон не полностью разрушил Осириса, оставив части Его тела, через которые Его жизнь затем возобновилась, так и человек не ест всё зерно, но сохраняет некоторую часть для посева в землю, чтобы жизненные процессы могли продолжиться. Человек также проходит через этот же цикл изменений, через детство, зрелость и старость; и для него также нет спасения от жертвенности, которое присуще всей жизни, но он перерождается снова и снова в своем цикле реинкарнаций.

История зерна - это история обычного человека, но история Солнца - это история человека, который становится божественным. В Египетских мистериях его называли Осирефицированным, а христианские мистики говорили о нем, как о том, кто становится единым с Христом, как когда Св. Павел обращался к своим ученикам: «Мои маленькие дети, которых я вновь рожаю, пока Христос не образуется в вас."* (^Gal., iv, 19.) Это добровольный характер божественного жертвоприношения отличает его от земных жертвоприношений. Становление человека божественным всегда объявлялось через бескорыстность и самопожертвование ради других; и вся история Христа и Осириса является сокращенным изложением и примером того, как это жертвоприношение может претворяться в жизни на Земле, как это происходит на небесах.

Исследования посвященного в Мистерии Осириса были расширены, чтобы включить истинное жилище человека, этот более высокий уровень ментального или небесного мира, в котором его Я действует в его причинном теле; и в то же время великое возвышение было объяснено на множественных уровнях интерпретации как спуск Логоса в материю, Его мистическая смерть и погребение, и Его воскрешение к бесконечному царству; а также как личное воплощение души в телах, его воскрешение из смерти в жизни недальних миров и его вновь рождающееся воплощение на Земле.

С... Мистерии Осириса были весьма схожи с теми, что мы имеем сегодня, хотя с... г... и д... использовались в Шотландских и Американских ритуалах; но слова были отличными, намного более позитивными по характеру. П... п... о... ф... были идентичны тем, что мы используем сейчас, и з... или т... также остались без изменений.

Внутренние Тайны Осириса

Внутри этой степени существовал также внутренний круг. Практическое обучение здесь проникало в высшие области ментальной плоскости, так что полностью подготовленный инициированный в Тайнах Осириса достигал полного сознания как личность, превосходящей ограничения одной персональной жизни, что больше всего людей знают.

Должность Мастера

После Третьей Степени перед вами открывались несколько путей развития в Тайнах. Им управление в Ложах; это имело место на протяжении многих лет, и предлагало великолепное обучение тем, кто его предпринимал. Каждый должностное лицо в Ложе имеет свое специальное дело для выполнения, свой собственный аспект Божества для проявления, свою собственную Священнодействие для передачи Ложе, в которой он является частью; прохождение обучения через последующие должности было и остается, поэтому, бесценным для получения всестороннего развития характера. На вершине древней системы Ремесла, степень I.M. существовала, которая давала гораздо большую власть, чем была предоставлена даже в Тайнах Осириса, и давала возможность Мастеру стать иерофантом Тайн по своему усмотрению, способным обучать и продвигать своих Brn. в тайном знании Египта. Обычно это блестящее положение достигалось лишь в старости, и к тому времени, когда Мастер управлял своей Ложей, он уже получил наиболее ценное обучение, которое вполне могло ускорить его эволюцию больше, чем несколько обычных жизней.

Та же последовательность передалась нам в масонстве сегодня, и каждый I.M. обладает мощью древних египетских жрецов; хотя это, безусловно, верно, что если бы он также обладал знаниями древних египетских жрецов, он мог бы использовать эту силу куда лучше.

Высшие Степени Тайн

Помимо обучения и тренировок, которые были предложены в Тайнах и по классификации были разделены на три степени, которые мы то рассмотрели, иерофанты также сделали свое дело, чтобы обучать и руководить теми, кто доказал, что готов к дальнейшему прогрессу. Нельзя утверждать, что в Египте существовали организованные степени после третьей, степени Осириса; но были индивидуальные уроки, которые приводили к получению еще больших способностей и к созданию связей с существами на еще более высоких уровнях.

Верховные степени Древнего и Принятого Шотландского Ритуала наших современных дней (возможно, учрежденные лишь в восемнадцатом веке, когда был сформирован Ритуал Совершенства или Гередома) в некоторой мере отражают эти более продвинутые направления развития, которые существовали в Египте. Поэтому, в следующем кратком изложении мы можем классифицировать их также, как они выражены в нашей Красной, Черной и Белой Фримасонии.

Красная Фримасония в Тайнах

Для тех М.М., которые жрецы, большей частью члены трех Великих Лож, считали перспективными, существовала, что мы нынче называем Красной Фримасонией, а также те учения, которые теперь включены в наш Королевский Лук и смежные степени, достигающие апогея в величественном поиске Рыцарей Розенкрейцев за потерянным словом, истинной божественностью человека.

В символическом обучении, соответствующем нашей степени Священного Королевского Лука, посвященного учили удалять со всех уровней его сознания все вуали, которые все еще препятствовали его взгляду на реальность, и затем при мощи этого взгляда самому распознавать Скрытый Свет в каждой форме, как бы глубоко он не был захоронен и скрыт от глаз плоти. Это символизировалось как восхождение, во время которого были преодолены четыре вуали, а затем поиск нисходящий за скрытой кладовой, глубоко похороненной в земле, в которой скрыто Имя Бога.

Центральной целью этой стадии было реальное осознание в сознании того, что многие есть Единое. До некоторой степени было известно неосвященным внешнего мира, что все странные божества Египта были на самом деле только проявлениями Одного, но они, вероятно, не осознавали факт единства в полной мере. В том, что соответствовало Королевскому Луку в Египте, мы сами обнаружили, что Бог есть во всем и спустился до самого низшего, чтобы самое низшее могло возникнуть. Мощи, предоставленные на этом этапе, позволяли кандидату до некоторой степени осознавать эту великую истину; ему предоставлялось определенное расширение сознания, которое ускоряло рост интуитивного принципа в нем, тем самым помогая ему распознавать божественное в других.

Между этим и следующим этапом прошло достаточно времени, в течение которого кандидат получал инструкции от священников и занимался медитацией на основе изученного. Постепенно он пришел к осознанию того, что, хоть он действительно обрел божественное Имя и приобщился к Скрытому Свету Бога, ему предстоит еще более глубокий поиск в сознании и сущности Божества. Именно тогда он начал свой второй поиск, который вел к ряду новых ступеней, во время которых он изучал и частично понимал разные аспекты Божества, пока не достиг великого просветления в Восемнадцатой Степени, которую мы сейчас называем Степенью Суверенного Принца Роза-Креста Хередома. Тогда кандидат осознал, что божественная Любовь царствует как в его собственном сердце, так и в сердцах его Братьев. Он также узнал, что Бог спустился и поделился с нами нашей низшей природой, чтобы мы могли подняться к нему, и поделиться с ним Его истинной сущностью.

Эта связь продолжает существовать сегодня для Brn. Роза-Креста, и каждый из них должен стать ярким центром той Любви, где бы он ни был, полностью забывая о себе в служении другим. Великолепные красные ангелы Роза-Креста, которые сейчас служат наши Суверенные Главы и изливают через них весь свой любовный поток ради помощи миру, также были известны в древнем Египте, и они были связаны с Суверенными Принцами на уровне их высших принципов, так что их серафическая любовь также была готова к излиянию благословения. Под их защитой кандидат был поручен, и он должен был осознать свою единую связь как с Ангелами, так и с его Братами.

На этом этапе интуиция или бхудди кандидата, та скрытая мудрость, которая есть Хорус или Христос внутри человека, была сильно пробуждена и возбуждена, так что кандидат в некоторой степени стал воплощением той вечной любви, которую в более поздние времена назвали Христом, и это дало ему возможность воздействовать на эмоциональную природу, которая является частичным отражением его самого в материи астрального мира, таким образом увеличивая свою способность любить до высот, которых он ранее не мог достигнуть. Теперь он стал настоящим священником, способным призывать и излучать божественную любовь для помощи миру. Более высокий уровень этой же самой чудесной силы позволяет Брату передать это расширение сознания и передовать эти великолепные связи другим; и это именно сила, которая сохраняется в наших современных Суверенных Главах для M.WS. и тех, кто прошел Стол в степени Роза-Креста.

Черное Масонство в Мистериях.

Немногие из наших египетских Братов преодолели границы Розы-Креста, потому что более чем достаточно было того великолепного откровения о внутренней Любви Бога, которое они получали на Восемнадцатом Степени. Однако для тех немногих, кто ощущал, что есть еще что-то большее для понимания природы Бога, и кто сильно желал понять суть зла, страданий и их роль в божественном плане, был представлен прототип нашей Черной Масонерии, включая учения и развитие на степенях с девятнадцатого до тридцатого. Этот раздел Тайн особенно фокусировался на расшифровке кармического закона в его различных аспектах, изучаемого как закон отмщения, в одном из представлений темный и ужасен. Вот в чем заключена истина, скрытая за моментами мести Степени Рыцаря К.П. Отрицательные аспекты кармы во многом связаны с человеческим незнанием природы Бога и замешательством, вызванным многочисленными формами его проявления. Именно так, с…с 30° содержат основу его философии. Полноценное и валидное присвоение этой степени невозможно, если эти с…с не были должным образом переданы, поскольку они актуализируют его внутреннее значение и предназначение.

В древней наставнической практике, соответствующей этой группе степеней, преподавали, что каждый человек пожнет то, что посеял, и если его семена были злобой, то результатом будет собственное страдание. Также изучали карму наций и рас, внутреннее действие этого закона на различных уровнях было изучено с помощью внутреннего взора и демонстрировалось ученику. Вся наша современная Черная Масонерия строится на обосновании кармы как божественной справедливости, что заметно в сегодняшнем 31°, то есть степени Великого Инспектора Инквизитора Командира, символом которого являются весы. В Египте эта пара весов служила эмблемой идеального равновесия божественной справедливости; аспирант узнавал, что весь ужас и зло, связанные с выполнением кармы, на самом деле базируются на совершенной справедливости, тогда как для меньшего сознания непосвященного это выглядело как зло.

Таким образом, первый этап высшего обучения, то есть Розы-Креста или Красная Масонерия, был посвящен пониманию добра, в то время как второй этап, то есть Рыцарей К.Х. или Черная Масонерия, был направлен на понимание зла. Затем, на первых ступенях того, что мы называем Белой Масонерией, цветушей всей этой величественной структуры, кандидат учился увидеть неоспоримую справедливость вечного Бога, Амена-Ра, стоящего за обоими - добром и законом в равной степени. В древности, до начала кали-юги, когда зло начинает преобладать над добром, Рыцари К.Х. носили регалии желтого цвета, а не черного.

Наш 30° связывает Рыцаря К.Х. с правящей, вместо ученической, ветвью Великой Иерархии; он должен стать сияющим центром неиссякаемой энергии, что даст ему силу преодолеть зло и сделать его реальной силой на стороне добра. Доминирующим цветом его влияния становится электрически синий (то есть Первого Луча, значительно отличающегося от синего, использующегося в символических или Синих Лоджиях) с золотым кантом, включающим, но не подавляющим розу 18°. Вместе со Степенью, связаны также великие синие Ангелы Первого Луча, которые дарят свою силу рыцарю, как это делают красные Ангелы, помогающие Превосходным и Совершенным Братьям Розы-Креста. Высший уровень этой энергии передается через то, что мы сегодня называем Креслом Верховного Командора, у которого есть способность передавать благодать Священнодействия степени другим.

Белая Масонерия в Тайнах.

Наивысшей и последней из великих мистерий, которые были переданы нам, является 33°, присваиваемый Верховному Гранд Инспектору-Генералу. В древнем Египте, каким я его помню, было всего три человека, обладавших эквивалентом этой верховной степени: Фараон и двое других. Они вместе образовали внутренний треугольник, который был сердцем всей системы мистерий и каналом Скрытого Света от Белой Ложи. Все трое были высокими инциатами Великого Белого Братства, и у Фараона был еще более высокий уровень власти, чем обычно присваивается на 33°, он был Коронованным и Помазанным Монархом.

Братьям этого высокого порядка можно сказать, что они перешли от понимания божественной справедливости к уверенности в знании и полноте божественной славы в Скрытом Свете. 33° связывает Верховного Гранд Инспектора-Генерала с самим Духовным Королем Мира - великим адептом, который стоит во главе Великой Белой Ложи и управляет судьбами земли, пробуждая силы тройного духа насколько это возможно. Само присвоение степени было и остается захватывающим опытом при взгляде внутренним зрением: иерофант мистерий (в наше время это H.O.A.T.F.) стоит выше Инициатора или рядом с ним, расширяя свое сознание, которое мы называем Ангелом Присутствия. Если получатель степени уже является Инициированным, Звезда (в Египте ее называли Звездой Хоруса), которая символизирует одобрение Единого Инициатора, вновь загорается во всей своей славе над ним. В любом случае два великих белых Ангела обряда спускаются с небес в своем величии, открывая себя до эфирного уровня, чтобы благословить кандидата.

Иерофант создает связи как с собой, так и с резервуаром сил, отведенным для работы Масонского Братства, и через себя с тем Великим Королем, чьим представителем он является. Великие белые Ангелы Ордена остаются защитниками Брата на протяжении всей его жизни. Тот, что справа, обладает ореолом сияющего белого света, пронизанного золотом, и представляет Осириса, солнце и жизнь, положительный аспект Божества. Тот, что слева, имеет аналогичный свет, но с серебряными прожилками, и представляет Исиду, луну и истину, отрицательный или женский аспект божественной славы. Их мощь строга и грандиозна, они придают силу действовать с уверенностью, точностью, мужеством и упорством на физической плоскости. Они принадлежат космическим порядкам Ангелов, которые общи для других солнечных систем, помимо нашей. Их постоянные центры сознания находятся на уровне интуиции, хотя их образы всегда возникают над головой инициата этой степени на высшем уровне мыслительной плоскости. Стоит помнить, что среди этих великих Ангелов нет половых различий, но один из них обладает преимущественно мужскими чертами, а другой - женскими.

Когда они сочтут это нужным, они материализуются в умственном и астральном формах - как на больших церемониях в Ложе - и всегда готовы даровать свое благословение, когда оно вызывается. Они тесно связаны с Верховным Великим Инспектором-Генералом, привязаны к его высшему "я", и никогда его не покидают, если только он сам, своей недостойностью, не отвергнет их. Символы солнца и луны, которые сегодня видны на перчатках Верховного Великого Инспектора-Генерала, направлены на означение этих великих ангельских мощей в внутренних мирах.

Силы, связанные с 33°, кажется, слегка изменились с времен Древнего Египта. Большие белые Ангелы в древних временах Египта казались более строгими; те, кто сегодня относятся к этой степени, некоторыми аспектами мягче, хотя их мощь не менее блескуча. Этот статус объединял чудесную любовь Хоруса Сына с непостижимой жизнью и силой Осириса, божественного Отца, и Исиды, вечной Матери мира; и это сочетание любви и силы до сих пор его самой выраженной характеристикой.

Оно дарует тем, кто под влиянием его влияния, силу на уровне и лишь чуть ниже силы первого великого Посвящения, и те, кто находится на 33°, должны без сомнения подготовиться к этому шагу в ближайшее время. В самом деле, во времена Великих Мистерий этот статус был доступен только для Посвященных, и сейчас кажется, что его следовало бы даровать только им. Также кажется уместным, что чудесный дар епископа должен быть данным только членам Великого Белого Братства. Сила этой степени проявляет себя в ослепительной бело-золотистой ауре, охватывающей в себе розу и синий цвета Роза-Креста и K.H.; и в ней также проявляется тот особенный оттенок электрического синего, который является особенным знаком присутствия Короля. Верховный Великий Инспектор-Генерал - это "епископ" Масонства, и если он действительно проживает жизнь данного статуса, он становится центром мощи, сияющей на все стороны, настоящим светилом света, жизни и славы куда бы он ни обратился.

Такова была наивысшая и самая священная из таинственных сил, переданных в тайнах древнего Египта, такова высшая проходная степень, известная нам в масонстве сегодня, предоставленная в полной мере лишь немногим. Шанс испытать ее великолепие предлагается каждому, кто получил эту степень. Насколько человек воспользуется этим и как он примет эту силу, зависит только от брата, потому что правильное использование этой силы требует высокого духовного развития и жизни, наполненной смирением, бдительностью и служением. Если брат использует эту силу для служения другим, она потечет через него мощным и благостным потоком, во благо всего мира. Если же он пренебрегает силой, она останется неактивной, связи не задействованы - и те, кто находится за ним, отвернутся к более достойным. Сила 33° - это настоящее море великолепия, силы и благости, ведь это сила самого Государя, Господа, который царствует на земле как Вице-Регент Логоса от века вовек.

Этапы Оккультного Пути

Всей этой великолепной схеме Египетских Мистерий Ложе Великого Белого Братства в той стране всегда стояла за спиной в тишине и тайне, охраняя их и используя их как канал Скрытого Света. Его существование оставалось неизвестным для всех, кто оставался за пределами внутренних кругов. Братство отбирало на посвящение в свои ряды только тех, кто выполнил древние условия, предъявляемые ко всем кандидатам на эту высокую степень. Требования к этой степени были сформулированы в Части I руководства по оккультной науке, сейчас известного как Свет на Пути, которое представляет учение Египетской Ложи. Обычно в качестве кандидатов выбирались братья, которые получали более глубокое обучение и готовились к посвящению многими годами медитаций, обучения и служения. Но иногда случалось, что посвящение получал тот, кто не проходил через внешние ступени Мистерий, но подготовил себя к этому в прошлых жизнях - ведь то, кто посвящается, это эго, а не личность нижних плоскостей.

Всегда существовало пять великих Посвящений, которые в христианском учении иллюстрировались этапами жизни Христа, описанными в Евангелиях, которые содержат элементы, заимствованные из учения Египетских Мистерий. Ученик Иисус был посвящён в Египетской Ложе, поэтому многие египетские символы были приняты его последователями и позже вплетены в эвангельскую историю. В книге Мастера и Путь я описывал некоторые церемонии Посвящения, применяемые в Великом Белом Братстве в наши дни. Египетские ритуалы отличались от них формой, но их суть была абсолютно идентичной. Египетская Ложа обладала традицией, переданной от инициированных Атлантиды, которая впоследствии была несколько модифицирована, чтобы соответствовать потребностям медленно развивающегося человечества арийской расы.

Первые Три Посвящения

Первое из истинных внутренних Посвящений получило название Рождение Гора, которое в той великой религии соответствует рождению Христа в Вифлееме по христианской традиции. Гор родился от Исиды, Девы-Матери; при его рождении звезда светила и ангельская армия торжественно пела; его обожествляли пастухи и мудрецы, и он был спасен от опасности, которая грозила ему извне. В "Книге Мертвых" говорится: "Я знаю силу Востока, Гора Солнечного Холма, Звезды Рассветной". История Посвященного - это история Солнечного Бога, Вселенского Христа, который рождается в сердце человека, его мистическое рождение является целью Первого Великого Посвящения.

Если кандидат ещё не прошел их, как это обычно делали большинство учеников Тайн, то на этом этапе ему предстояло пройти испытания на земле, воде, воздухе и огне, получив полную уверенность, что ни один из этих элементов не может навредить ему в астральном теле. Это было подготовительным этапом к службе на астральном уровне, поскольку Посвященный должен был сделать себя надежным и полезным слугой человечества в этом и в других измерениях.

Второе Великое Посвящение соответствует той стадии жизни Христа, которая символизируется Крещением, в ходе которого происходит расширение интеллектуальных способностей, как и великолепное пробуждение эмоциональной природы является результатом Первого Посвящения. Именно на этом этапе в жизни кандидата происходит внутреннее испытание, олицетворяемое соблазном в пустыне. Затем наступает великолепие Преображения, когда Монада спускается и преображает эго в образ своей славы.

Четвертое Посвящение

Четвертое Великое Посвящение соответствует страстям и Воскресению Христа; кандидат должен пройти через долину смертной тени, испытав наибольшие страдания и одиночество, чтобы навсегда восстать к полноте бессмертия. Этот страшный и великолепный опыт - это реальность, которая отражается на почти бесконечном расстоянии в степени M.M.; через портал смерти он восходит к вечной славе Воскресения.

Некоторые части ритуала Четвертого Посвящения, согласно египетскому обряду, странно переплетены с христианскими учениями и стопроцентно материализовались и исказились, подобно тому как легенда об Осирисе искажалась в Египте. Правило этой части Посвящения звучало так:

Затем кандидата привязывают к деревянному кресту, он умирает, его хоронят, и он спускается в подземелье; после третьего дня его возвращают из мертвых и восносят на небо, чтобы быть правой рукой Того, от кого он пришел, научившись управлять живыми и мертвыми. (^ Христианский Символ Веры, от православного епископа C.W. Leadbeater, стр. 98.)

Во время церемонии кандидат ложился на деревянный крест, выпуклость которого повторяла форму его тела. Его руки слегка обвязывали веревками с свободными концами, символизирующими добровольность жертвоприношения. Затем кандидат входил в состояние транса, покидал физическое тело и в полном сознании переходил на астральную плоскость. Его тело опускали в склеп под храмом и помещали в огромный саркофаг, где оно находилось в течение трех дней и трех ночей в глубинах земли.

Во время мистической смерти тела кандидат прошел много странных испытаний в астральном мире, и проповедовал "духам в тюрьме", тем, кто недавно покинул тело после смерти и были еще скованы страстями и желаниями.

Утром четвертого дня его погребения тело кандидата воскресали из саркофага и выносили на воздух по восточной стороне большой пирамиды, чтобы первые лучи восходящего солнца могли разбудить его от его долгого сна.

Именно на этой Инициации кандидат поднимался в "небеса", чтобы получить расширение сознания на духовной плоскости, часто называемой атмической или нирванической. Это уровень абсолютного единения, и это сознание знает все изнутри, оно едино со всем и во всем. Таким образом, Инициат становился "правой рукой Того, от Кого он пришел", посвященного навсегда служению Богу и людям, и его задачей отныне было направлять живых и мертвых к Скрытому Свету, в котором одном находится мир. Редко бывает так прекрасно и величественно изъяснена великая истина о том, что вся полученная сила доверена лишь для помощи другим.

В "Скрытом Свете Масонства" я нахожу определенные соответствия между тремя степенями в Синем Масонстве и Великими Инициациями, показываю, что Инициация E.A. отражает великий шаг вступления на испытательный путь, что Переход можно сравнить с Первым Великим Посвящением, а воскрешение напоминает Четвертую Инициацию.* (См. там же, стр. 75 и 185). Теперь мы можем добавить в эту таблицу Египетские Мистерии, всегда помня, конечно, о глубоких различиях между этими Орденами и стадиями Пути:

THE FIFTH INITIATION AND BEYOND

Only one more stage remains before human perfection is reached - that which is typified by the Ascension into heaven. At this Fifth Initiation the Adept ascends above all earthly life and becomes One with that aspect of the Deity which in Christianity we call God the Holy Ghost.* (^See The Masters and the Path.)

And still there are higher stages, greater steps upon the Path, though belonging no longer to human evolution but to the development of the Superman. Even here our Masonic ceremonies reflect in symbol something of those higher glories, giving the key to the whole vast plan. Far above the grade of Adept, He who is the Christ stands as the Lord of Love, the Teacher of Angels and men, and along this line of interpretation His high stage of evolution is reflected in the 18°, which  is essentially a degree of Christhood. Equal with Him, but on the Ray of Rule, stands the Manu, whose rank is mirrored at an almost infinite distance in the 30°; and as the crown of the whole Hierarchy there reigns the One Initiator,* (^Ibid., Ch. xiv.) whose life and light and glory are adumbrated in the splendour of the 33°. Thus the whole wondrous plan of Masonic initiation is a shadow of things seen above “in the Mount”; and herein lies the greatness of our mighty brotherhood and its value to mankind.

Much lower down there are still correspondences. The 18° means glowing love and beauty, but that is mirrored in the position of the W.J.W; the 30° gives a wonderful outpouring of strength, which is typified by the column of the W.S.W., while the wisdom and all-embracing sympathy of the 33° should be reflected in the attitude of the R.W.M. of the Lodge.

2      THE CRETAN MYSTERIES

THE UNITY OF THE MYSTERIES

THE group of beliefs and practices to which we give the name of the Mysteries has existed in many countries and in different forms, most of which have influenced Freemasonry to a greater or a lesser extent. Widely spread as they were, their unity of origin is to be seen in the fact that they had a certain framework which was always the same, although they showed divergences in minor matters. In those days, just as at the present time, a Bro. from a foreign Jurisdiction who wished to visit had to prove himself at the door of the Lodge; for whatever differences there may have been in the outer forms of the ritual, the s … s were always the same, for these are the keys to the sacramental powers lying behind all the systems of the Mysteries alike.

LIFE IN ANCIENT CRETE

One of the most striking instances of this unity is to be found in Crete, where the comparatively recent discoveries of Sir Arthur Evans have disclosed many Masonic symbols and forms, resembling very closely those of Egypt. Like Gaul in the days of Caesar, ancient Crete was divided into three parts or states - Knossos, Goulas and Polurheni. The King of Knossos was Overlord of the whole island, for the rulers, of the other states acknowledged him as their leader, although they were perfectly free to manage their own internal affairs. There was also, in the south of the island, an independent city with a few miles of territory attached to it.

All these Kings were also ex-officio high priests, as in Egypt, and the King’s palace was always the principal temple of his State. The people worshipped a dual deity - Father-Mother - and these two were regarded as one, though some men offered their devotion more to the Father-aspect, and some to the Mother. The Father, when spoken of separately, was called Brito, and the Mother Diktynna. No statues were made of these deities, but great reverence was paid to their symbol, which was a double-headed axe. (See Plate I, 1, following p. 50.) This was carved in stone and made in metal, and set up in the temples where one would naturally expect a statue, and a conventional drawing of it represented the deity in the writing of the period. This double axe was called labrys, and it was for it originally that the celebrated labyrinth was built, to symbolize to the people the difficulty of finding the Path to God.

Much of their religious service and worship was carried on out of doors. Various remarkable isolated peaks of rock were regarded as sacred to the Great Mother, and the King and his people went out to one or other of these on certain days in each month, and chanted prayers and praises. A fire was lit, and each person wove a sort of crown of leaves for himself, wore it for awhile, and then threw it into the fire as an offering to the Mother-God. Each of these peaks had also a special yearly festival, much like a Pardon in Brittany - a kind of semi-religious village fair, to which people came from all parts of the island to picnic in the open air for two or three days, and enjoyed themselves hugely. In one case a great old tree of enormous size and unusually perfect shape was regarded as sacred to Diktynna, and offerings were made under its branches. A vast amount of incense was burnt under it, and it was supposed that the leaves somehow absorbed and retained the scent, so when they fell in autumn they were carefully collected and distributed to the people, who regarded them as talismans which protected them from evil. That these dried leaves had a strong fragrance is undeniable, but how far it was due to the incense seems problematical.

The people were a fine-looking race, obviously Greek in type; their dress was simple, for the men in ordinary life usually wore nothing but a loincloth, except when they put on gorgeous official costumes for religious or other festivals. The women wore a cloth which covered the whole body, but was arranged something like an Indian dhoti in the lower part, giving rather the effect of a divided skirt.

The interior of the island was mountainous, not unlike Sicily, and there was much beautiful scenery. The architecture was massive, but the houses were curiously arranged. On entering, one came directly into a large hall like a church, in which the entire family and the servants lived all day, the cooking being done in one corner. At the back was a covered passage (as in the houses in Java at the present day) leading to what was in effect a separate building, in which were the sleeping rooms. These were quite small and dark - mere cubicles - but open all round for about two feet under the roof, so that there was ample ventilation. Round the wall of this hall under the roof usually ran a frieze of painted bas-relief - generally a procession, executed in the most spirited style.

The buildings were of granite, and there were many statues of granite, though also some made of a softer stone, and some of copper and wood. Iron was used by this race, but not much; the principal metal was copper. The pottery was distinctly peculiar; all the commonest articles were made of bright yellow earthenware, painted with all sorts of figures. These figures were generally on a broad white band round the middle of the pot, and the colours used were nearly always red, brown or yellow - very rarely blue or green. These were the common household pots; but for the table they had porcelain and glass - both very well made. Most of the glass was of a bluish-green tint, like some of the old Venetian glass - not colourless like ours. The richer people used many vessels of gold, wonderfully chased and sometimes set with jewels. These people were especially clever at jewellers’ work of all sorts, and made elaborate ornaments. One sees among them no diamonds or rubies - chiefly amethysts, jasper and agate. But many ornaments were evidently imported, for they had statuettes and models in carved ivory.

These people had two kinds of writing, evidently corresponding to the hieroglyphic and the demotic in Egypt, but they were quite different from the Egyptian. A decimal system was used in calculating, and arithmetic generally seems to have been well understood. These Cretans were good sailors, and had a powerful fleet of galleys, some with as many as sixty oars. They used sails also - sails which were wonderfully painted; but apparently they employed them only when the wind was almost directly astern.

THE CRETAN RACE

These people were an arm or family of the fourth or Keltic sub-race of the fifth or Aryan race. In Chapter XIX of Man: Whence, How and Whither a brief history of that sub-race is given; it includes the following remarks on the subject of the origin of the Cretans:

The first section [of the fourth sub-race] to cross into Europe from Asia Minor were the ancient Greeks - not the Greeks of our ‘Ancient History’, but their far-away ancestors, those who are sometimes called Pelasgians. It will be remembered that the Egyptian priests are mentioned in Plato’s Timaeus and Critias as having spoken to a later Greek of the splendid race which had preceded his own people in his land; how they had turned back an invasion from the mighty nation from the West, the conquering nation that had subdued all before it, until it shivered itself against the heroic valour of these Greeks. In comparison with these, it was said, the modern Greeks - the Greeks of our history who seem to us so great - were as pigmies. From these sprang the Trojans who fought with the modern Greeks, and the city of Agade in Asia Minor was peopled by their descendants.

These, then, had held for a long time the sea-board of Asia Minor and the islands of Cyprus and Crete, and all the trade of that part of the world was carried in their vessels. A fine civilization was gradually built up in Crete, which endured for thousands of years. The name of Minos will ever be remembered as its founder or chief builder, and he was of these elder Greeks, even before 10,000. B.C.* (^Op. cit., pp. 309-10.)

RECENT DISCOVERIES IN CRETE

It is only since the year 1900 that, largely owing to the work of Sir Arthur Evans, the modern world has come to know something about the Cretan civilization, and to realize that in age and splendour it compared even with the grandeur of ancient Egypt. But even now, though there is abundant appreciation of the archaeological value of the Cretan discoveries, not much attention has yet been given by Freemasons to the highly interesting fact that the Minoan civilization shows us the existence, five thousand years ago at least, of a Mystery-religion which in its symbols and general arrangements closely resembles our modern ritual. One feature of those Cretan Mysteries especially attractive to Co-Masons is that in them women were admitted as well as men. The admission of women was the practice of almost all the Mysteries of the ancient world, but clearer traces of the fact remain to-day in Crete than in any other country. These Mysteries do not lie in the direct line of Masonic descent; but the archaeological remains of initiatory rites are so plentiful and so strikingly similar to our present system as to be exceptionally interesting.

For those who are not conversant with the results of the excavations in Crete, it may be well to give a brief survey of the historical knowledge gained by their aid. Until recently most text-books of history taught that the Greek civilization began in the eighth century B.C. There  were traditions of an older civilization, with a centre in Crete, where King Minos reigned in his palace in Knossos, and another on the mainland of Greece, where in the Mycenaean cities Agamemnon and his heroes had prepared for the expedition against Troy, but these accounts were taken to be of purely legendary character until the bold perseverance of Schliemann actually laid bare the walls of ancient Troy and discovered the tombs of the Mycenaean kings, and so compelled the historians to realize that in this case as in others legend had been  truer than history.

The discoveries in Crete were even more striking. When Sir Arthur Evans began his excavations on the site of ancient Knossos he not only laid bare the palace of King Minos, but also a series of successive strata indicative of a continuous civilization of a very high character stretching over a period of several thousand years. It was shown that the old legends of the labyrinth of Crete and the terrible Minotaur, supposed to dwell in its innermost depths, were based on fact, not on fancy. It is now known also that at the time of the first dynasty in Egypt there flourished in the island of Crete a civilization as powerful as the Egyptian. With regard to it Sir Arthur Evans says:

The proto-Egyptian element in Early Minoan Crete is, in fact, so clearly defined and is so intensive in its nature as almost to suggest something more than such a connection as might have been brought about by primitive commerce. It may well, indeed, be asked whether, in the time of stress and change that marked the triumph of the dynastic element in the Nile Valley, some part of the older population then driven out may not have made an actual settlement on the soil of Crete.* (^The Palace of Minos at Knossos, vol. I, p. 17.)

Though the civilizations of ancient Egypt and Crete have much in common, yet each had distinctly a genius of its own, and much of the similarity between them can be explained by the fact that for long ages not only the Delta, but Middle and Upper Egypt stood in continuous relation with Minoan Crete.

It is not our object to enter into a further description of this Minoan civilization, which in many respects was equal if not superior to that of our own times. We are here concerned chiefly with the religion and the ritual usages of the ancient Minoans, which in their details show such a remarkable likeness to modern Freemasonry. Since the Minoan script cannot yet be deciphered, we are but very partially informed about the thoughts and the beliefs of the Minoan race, but  from the objects found and the monuments discovered some conclusions may be drawn which are sufficient for our present purpose.

WORSHIP IN CRETE

The main worship appears to have centred round the feminine aspect of the deity already mentioned who, like Isis amongst the Egyptians and Demeter amongst the later Greeks, symbolized the creative power and fostering care of mother-nature. Connected with her worship was the sacred tree, depicted in so many presentations of Minoan shrines, while the deity herself was associated with the dove, the lion, the fish and the snake, typifying her dominion over air, earth, water and the fire within the earth.

As I have written above, the most sacred symbol in Minoan worship was the double axe or labrys. This, mounted on a stone column, is found in the shrines of ancient Crete, and when depicted on any object or building invariably denotes its sacred character. (See Plate I, 1 and Plate IV, 1, following p. 50.)

It was always an emblem of the most High God, and is in reality the ancestor of the Master’s gavel, which he bears because in his humble way he represents the All-Commander, ruling his Lodge in the name of the Spiritual King. In Crete we often find it associated with what is called the sacral knot (Plate I, 2, following p. 50). When thus combined it closely resembles the Egyptian ankh, the token of immortality. (Plate I, 3. following p. 50.)

The Mother-Goddess Dictynna denoted the productivity and creative power of nature; this double axe, especially when surmounted by the sacral knot, signified the eternal truth of death and resurrection, which was the central mystery of the religion of Crete as it was of that of Egypt; and so it was often laid before her to typify the ever-recurring miracle of the rebirth of tree and grain from the death of winter. The very form of the labyrinth in the recesses of which this sacred emblem was concealed was in itself symbolical and full of meaning; it was based upon the cross, and the representations of it on seals and coins sometimes take the shape of the swastika (Plate I, 4, following p. 50).

Connected with this outer religious worship in ancient Crete there were Mysteries of initiation for the few, and it is in these that we find the main elements of similarity to Freemasonry. In the palace of Minos at Knossos, as also in the palace of Phaestos - another Cretan site - we find pillared crypts and chambers which were indubitably of a sacred and initiatory character. The most important of these rooms is the so-called throne-room in the palace of Minos, which derives its name from the magnificent sculptured throne which was found intact when excavated (see Plate II, 1, following p. 50).

THE THRONE ROOM

With regard to this room, Sir Arthur Evans says:

It is now clear that a large part of the West Wing of the Palace was little more than a conglomeration of small shrines, of pillared crypts designed for ritual use, and corresponding halls above. The best preserved existing chamber of this Quarter, the ‘Room of the Throne’, teems with religious suggestion. With its elaborately carved cathedral seat in the centre and stone benches round, the sacral griffins guarding on one side the entrance to an inner shrine, on the other the throne itself, and, opposite, approached by steps, its mysterious basin, it might well evoke the idea of a kind of consistory or chapter-house. A singularly dramatic touch, from the moment of final catastrophe, was here, indeed, supplied by the alabastra standing on the floor, beside the overturned oil jar for their filling, with a view, we may infer, to some ceremony of anointing. It is impossible to withhold the conclusion that the ‘Room of the Throne’ at Knossos was designed for religious functions.

The salient features in its arrangement (Plate II, 2, following p. 50), in fact, suggest an interesting comparison with a ritual chamber recently discovered in one of the kindred Anatolian sanctuaries. This is the ‘Hall of Initiation’ excavated by the British explorers in the sanctuary of Men Askaenos and a Mother Goddess, described as Demeter, near the Pisidian Antioch. The throne itself, the stone benches round, and the ‘tank’ on the opposite side to the throne, find all their close analogies, and are arranged in the same relative positions. In the Galatian Sanctuary we see, on a larger scale it is true, a chamber with a throne - in this case near, not actually against the back wall - to the right of the entrance, while opposite it on the left side on entering the chamber is an oblong tank. Here, too, along the back wall runs a rock-cut bench or divan, and the chamber was approached by an ante-room or pronaos.

Cult arrangements are often handed down almost unaltered through long periods of years, and the striking analogies here presented afford a real presumption for believing that the much earlier Room of the Throne at Knossos and its adjoining tank were devised for similar rites of initiation and purification. Like him who presided over these Anatolian rites, a Minoan priest-king may have sat upon the throne at Knossos, the adopted Son on earth of the Great Mother of its island mysteries. Such a personage, indeed, we may actually recognize in the Palace relief of a figure wearing a plumed lily crown and leading, we may believe, the sacral Griffin. It is probable, indeed, that in Crete the kingly aspect was more to the fore than in the religious centres of Asia Minor. But both the actual evidence from the palace site and the divine associations attributed to Minos lead to the conclusion that here, too, each successive dynast was ‘a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedech’ and ‘made like unto the Son of God’.

There is little doubt that in the room thus described we find one of the Minoan temples of the Mysteries. Most probably, as Sir Arthur Evans suggests, the throne which is shown in the chamber was the seat of the Hierophant, and on the stone benches round the walls were ranged the Brn. who took part in the ritual. The candidates for initiation had to undergo a preliminary purification in the lustral basin before they could be admitted to the ceremonies.

THE THREE COLUMNS

A plan of this Minoan Temple is shown in Plate II, 2 (following p. 50). Facing the throne of the Hierophant were three columns, which are frequently found in the mystery religion of Crete and were closely connected with its rites. The evidence that the three columns bore a sacred meaning is to be found in one of the terra-cotta models belonging to a votive shrine, which often supply us with additional information about the Cretan Mysteries. (See Plate II, 3, following p. 50.) We will quote Sir Arthur Evans’ description of the three columns surmounted by doves (which repeatedly occur in various models of Minoan shrines), and his explanation of their religious meaning:

But of all these remains, the highest religious interest attaches to a terra-cotta group belonging to some religious structure on a larger scale than the others. It consists of three columns on a common base, supporting in each case, above their square ‘capital’, the round ends of a pair of beams on which a dove is perched (Plate II, 3, following p. 50). The square ‘capital’ itself and the beam ends above it must here be regarded as the equivalent, in an epitomized shape, of the roof beams and entablature of a building. In other words, they are the Pillars of the House, and the doves settled above them are the outward and visible sign of the divine presence and protection. A clay seal with a similar device of a dove perched above roof-beams resting on a column, itself set on an altar base as in the Lion’s Gate scheme, has now come to light at Mycenae - a singular illustration of the Minoan source of its cult.

Of the columns themselves, each one may be regarded as a separate religious entity, since in place of a common entablature the superstructure is in each case separately rendered by a kind of architectural shorthand. This Trinity of baetylic pillars (which has many parallels in Semitic cult) itself recalls the triple arrangement seen in the case of the Temple Fresco at Knossos and of several late Minoan and Mycenaean shrines. The triple gold shrines of Mycenae are also coupled with seated doves.

The seated birds, as already observed, symbolize in this and other cases the descent of the divinity into the possessed object. At times, as in the above instances, it is the baetylic pillar or the cell that enshrines it. The celebrated scene on the sarcophagus of Hagia Triada shows raven-like birds brought down by ritual strains and libations on to the sacred Double Axes, which are thus ‘charged’ as it were with the divinity. The doves on the gold chalice from Mycenae and of ‘Nestor’s Cup’ repeat the same idea.

But it was not only the cult object itself that could be thus sanctified by the descending emblem of spiritual indwelling. In the case of the gold plates from the Third Shaft Grave at Mycenae the doves are seen not only perched on the Shrine but on the head and fluttering from the shoulders of a nude female personage (Plate III, 2, following p. 50). So too the central clay image from the late ‘Shrine of the Double Axes’ at Knossos shows the dove settled on her head. In these cases we have either images of the Dove Goddess herself, reinforced by what may have been her older zoomorphic form, or of a priestess deified by the descent of the dove-spirit.

The extent to which primitive Minoan religious conceptions were familiar to the Semitic mind is here again illustrated by the striking parallel of the baptism in Jordan and the picture drawn by the evangelists of the Holy Spirit ‘descending in bodily shape like a dove’ and ‘lighting on’ Jesus. What has to be borne in mind in all these connexions is that it is not only the inanimate or aniconic object, such as the pillar or the sacred weapon, that may become, through due ritual, the temporary dwelling-place of the divinity, but that the spiritual Being may enter into the actual worshipper or votary in human form, who for the time becomes a God, just as the baptized Christian becomes alter Christos. This ‘possession’ is often marked by soothsaying and ecstatic dances, and an orgiastic dance on a Late Minoan signet, to be described below, finds its pictorial explanation in the descent of the goddess. Musical strains such as those of the lyre or the conch-shell or the sistrum of Egyptian cult were a means of invocation.

These highly interesting terra-cotta models illustrating the religious structures and ideas of the M.M. II Period are supplemented by an object - the scale of which answers to the same series as the group of columns - in the form of a portable seat (Plate II, 3, following p. 50). Within it are some remains of the lower part and attachments of a figure. It is evident that we have here a palanquin either for a divinity or for his earthly representative, the Priest-King, recalling the sedia-gestatoria still used by the Papa-Re at Rome.* (^Op. cit., pp. 222, 223, 224.)

In its general arrangements the ritual chamber of the palace of Phaestos was similar to the Masonic temple in the palace of Minos, but it contained no throne - an omission which is explained by the portable seat found in the shrine. Evidently in some cases the initiator in the Mysteries was carried in procession and retained the seat in which he had been borne.

MODELS OF SHRINES

The accompanying figures (Plate III, 1; Plate IV, 1, 2, 3, following p. 50) show models of fresco paintings of Minoan shrines. In Plate III, 1, a gold plaque from Mycenae, we see again the three columns surmounted by the horns of consecration which, like the double axe, denote the sacred character of the object, and the ritual significance is further emphasized by the doves perched on the ends of the sacred horns. In looking at these illustrations of Minoan sanctuaries we must remember that the side walls of the chamber are flattened out in the picture and not drawn in perspective, so that we must in imagination fold the two side panels of the picture of the shrine forward so as to form three walls of a shrine room. Underneath the pillars in the different illustrations the floors are paved, as shown in Plate IV, 2 and 3 (following p. 50), in black and white squares similar to the mosaic pavement of the Masonic Lodge.

In the Minoan sanctuaries we have so far seen the seat of the Hierophant or Master on one side, the benches for the brethren round the walls, three sacred columns as the principal furniture of the temple and a mosaic pavement of alternating dark and light squares in the centre. In addition, in some of the model shrines we find on one side of the room two pillars side by side; this arrangement was also discovered with the two pillars standing in the excavation of the crypt in the Palace of Minos (see Plate V, 1, following p. 50). Of these crypts Sir Arthur Evans says:

There is clear evidence, as shown below, that such pillared crypts fulfilled a religious function and stood in relation to a columnar shrine above. There can be little doubt that we have here the remains of an important sanctuary facing the inner sea gate of the Palace.* (^Op. cit., p. 404.)

THE ALTAR OBJECTS

Still further evidence of the Masonic character of the Minoan rites is shown by the remarkable objects found in the temple repositories in which were kept the different altar-objects connected with the ritual worship in the chamber of initiation. Sir Arthur Evans has rearranged these objects on the altar ledge for which they were no doubt intended, and we show a reproduction of his arrangement in Plate V, 2 (following p. 50). Perhaps the most arresting feature is the marble cross in the centre of the altar. The cross with equal arms, or Greek cross, as well as the Latin cross and the swastika, are found repeatedly in connection with the Minoan cult, and since in all ages the cross has symbolized either the mystery of creation and the descent of the divine life into manifestation, or else the mystic death and resurrection of the soul, we have here striking evidence that these conceptions were also at the base of the Cretan Mysteries.

On either side of the cross on the altar ledge the figures wear aprons, which were clearly of a ritual character, for they are not to be met with in ordinary Cretan dress (see Plate V, 3, following p. 50). The apron was evidently double, extending both in front and at the back, and differed in details in the case of the goddess and her priestess. It is possible, and in some respects even probable, that both female figures found on the altar are worshippers of the cross and the triple snake, in which case the different character of the two aprons may well denote a difference in the rank or degree of the wearers. Evans expresses his opinion that the double aprons are of a ritual character.* (^Op. cit., p. 503.)

VARIOUS SYMBOLS

There were also some lesser religious symbols and objects which are of such decidedly Masonic character that they are worth mentioning. In Plate VI, 1 (following p. 50), we see a relic of bone found in the temple repository which, as Evans says “is in the shape alternately of flowers and buds, suggested by those of a pomegranate”. Further symbols familiar to Freemasons are the frequently recurring sun and moon, shown in our illustration (Plate VI, 2 and 3, following p. 50) on a bronze votive tablet from the Psychro cave, and a gold ring from Mycenae. With regard to the former Evans says:

The tree, dove and fish, which here appear as the vehicles of divine possession, aptly symbolize her dominion of earth, air and sea. The triple group of sacral horns further emphasize the threefold aspect of the cult, which also explains the triple basin of the Libation Table. So, too, we see the pillar shrines of the goddess, like that of the Knossian wall-painting, regularly divided into three compartments.

Both the votive tablet and the ring are full of religious meaning and Masonic symbolism, and well repay close study. They incidentally show how far the Minoan worship spread from Crete to the mainland. Similarly the introduction of the Masonic square as a decorative pattern on a vase found in Aphidna on the mainland of Greece is of interest as showing that with the spread of Minoan culture to the Mycenaean settlements the symbols of the Minoan mystery religion too were carried abroad. (See Plate VII, 1, following p. 50.)

THE STATUETTES

But these evidences of Masonic symbolism, decisive as they are, are surpassed by the testimony presented by a number of statuettes and votive figures found in Crete or in the outposts of Minoan civilization, which are represented in such indubitably Masonic attitudes (some of which now belong to the higher degrees) that even the most sceptical student must acknowledge that no chance can explain this similarity. (See Plates VII and VIII following p. 50.) It would not be in accordance with Masonic secrecy to mention the degrees to which the different attitudes belong, but all Masons will readily recognize them. Ridiculous as these statuettes are, if they were the only evidence found in Crete they would be sufficient to indicate the existence of Mysteries of a Masonic Character in that ancient civilization. But where that evidence is supported by the various proofs discussed above no doubt can remain that four thousand years ago and more there existed in Crete Mysteries in which Masonic signs and symbols were used, which admitted both men and women, and performed their rites  in temples very similar to those of modern Freemasonry.

2      THE JEWISH MYSTERIES

THE JEWISH LINE OF DESCENT

ALTHOUGH our modern Freemasonic rites and symbols are derived from Egypt, as has been shown in The Hidden Life in Freemasonry, they have reached us for the most part through the Jews. The tradition which has most influenced our modern Masonry is that of the Jewish Mysteries, so the greater part of our ceremonies and s … s are now cast in a Jewish form.

In The Hidden Life in Freemasonry it has been explained that many of the traditions preserved in the Old Testament have a basis in fact, although the actual events of Jewish history were magnified and distorted through the lens of an almost fanatical patriotism by the later compilers of the records. The Jewish scriptures as we have them today were almost entirely rewritten after the return from the captivity; and the priestly writers who did this work transfigured in a glow of enthusiastic romance the poetic traditions of their nation.

THE JEWISH MIGRATIONS

The Jewish race is an offshoot of that Semitic people who formed the fifth sub-race of the Atlantean root-race. Some four thousand years before the great cataclysm of 75,025 B.C., which overwhelmed the first Atlantean empire of Egypt, the Manu had led His especial followers into the uplands of Arabia in order that they might be separated from the bulk of the Atlanteans, and that a new type might be evolved from them which would later be developed into the Aryan root-race. Strict injunctions were given by the Manu that there was to be no intermarriage with neighbouring races, so that the purity of the new stock might be maintained; and the idea of these men that they were a “chosen people” was fostered to that end. Shortly before the cataclysm some seven hundred of the best and most promising of these people were led into Central Asia by the Manu, and they grew there after many thousands of years into a great nation, the nucleus of the Aryan race that was later to rule the world.

About 40,000 B.C. the Manu led out the second sub-race of the new root-race to colonize Arabia once more, since the Semites who had been left behind were the closest of the Atlantean peoples to the new stock. Arabia became a great Aryan kingdom, excepting only a certain section of those inhabiting the southern part of the peninsula, who declined to recognize the Manu or to intermarry with His people, quoting His own regulation against Him in defence of their refusal. Later this tract of country was conquered by the Aryans, and a fanatical section of its inhabitants forsook their homes, and settled on the opposite coast of the Red Sea in what we now call Somaliland. Here they lived for several centuries, but in consequence of an attempt on the part of the majority to intermarry with the negroes of the interior, a fairly large minority of them withdrew from the community, and, after many wanderings, found themselves in Egyptian territory. The Pharaoh of the period, interested in their story, offered them an outlying district of his kingdom if they chose to settle there. Eventually some Pharaoh made a demand upon them for additional taxation and forced work which they considered an infringement of their privileges; and they once more undertook a wholesale migration under the leadership of him whom we now call Moses, and after further wanderings settled in Palestine, where they were known as the Jews, still strongly maintaining that they were a chosen people.* (^See Man: Whence, How and Whither, Ch. xiv and xvi, passim.)

During their sojourn in Egypt certain of them had been initiated into some of the degrees of the Egyptian Mysteries. Moses, as was said much later, “was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians”,* (^Acts, vii, 22.) and he seems to have been the real founder of the Jewish Mysteries, much as tradition suggests, introducing into them the succession of I.M.s which he had received from the Egyptian priests. Our investigations have not confirmed the events related in the early chapters of the book of Exodus with regard to the ten plagues and the smiting of the Egyptians; the Jews departed without much opposition, and after many years of wandering in the wilderness conquered various tribes and took possession of Palestine. Indeed their migration seems to have been inspired to some extent by the Manu. During their wanderings they used a tent for the celebration of their Mysteries, preserved in Hebrew tradition as the tabernacle; in this they worked in essence the Egyptian rituals, though the whole celebration was under such conditions on a much smaller and less splendid scale. These are the facts lying behind the Masonic tradition of the First or Holy Lodge.

THE PROPHETS

It appears that Moses was also acquainted with the great ritual of Amen as worked in the Mysteries of Egypt, and some portion at least of this tradition was transmitted to his successors. There arose in later times a school in connection with the Mysteries, the members of which had the idea of personifying the children of Israel as one Being who might shed blessing over all nations; and they attempted to arouse among them the sense of unity necessary for this purpose partly by means of ritual. There were also the schools of the prophets, who were trained in the Mysteries and studied the deeper teaching enshrined in the ancient rites. One such school is mentioned in the Old Testament as existing at Naioth under the direction of the prophet Samuel,* (^Sam., xix, 20.) and there were others later at Bethel and Jericho.* (^II Kings, ii, 2, 5.)

These schools were not so much concerned with prophecy in our modern sense of foretelling the future, as with endeavouring to instruct the people by preaching; they seem to have resembled in many ways the preaching friars sent out by the Roman Church during the middle ages, the Franciscans and other Orders. These preachers were chosen from among the Levites, and were sent forth to proclaim the deeper teaching in a popular form. It is probable that many of the greater Jewish prophets belonged to a later development of these schools - Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and others - but they were always somewhat pessimistic in their outlook, even though several of them unquestionably touched high levels of consciousness in their visions. Their method was apparently to throw themselves into a state of tremendous exaltation, and then to look up into a higher plane through a kind of shaft which they had opened. It was in this way that Ezekiel saw the vision of the four Kings of the elements. These Great Ones can be seen clearly only with the sight of the spiritual or nirvanic plane; it does not appear that Ezekiel had touched that exalted level directly, but he became aware of it in his ecstasy as though looking up to it from below.

THE BUILDERS OF K. S. T.

Something both of the inner powers and of the Egyptian rituals had been faithfully handed down from generation to generation from the days of Moses until King Solomon came to the throne of his father David. There is some truth in the tradition preserved in the Bible, although there are exaggerations and mistakes in the accounts which have come down to us, and much of the inner meaning of the symbols had been forgotten. King Solomon seems to have been a man of considerable force of character and some occult knowledge, and the great ambition of his life was to weld his people into a strong and respected kingdom, able to take an influential place among the nations around. To that end he built the temple in Jerusalem to be the centre of the religious worship of his people and a symbol of their national unity; it was perhaps not quite so magnificent as tradition relates, but the King was nevertheless extremely proud of it and considered it to be one of the great achievements of the age.

In this work he was assisted by his ally, Hiram King of Tyre, who supplied a quantity of material for the building, and lent many clever craftsmen to aid in the work; for the Phoenicians were more skilled in building than the Jews, who were chiefly a pastoral people. Also about fifty years before some of the wandering bands of Masons who called themselves the Dionysian Artificers had settled in Phoenicia, so King Hiram was able to supply many expert workmen. This alliance is a matter of secular history, for Josephus tells us that even in his day copies of the letters which passed between the two Kings existed in the Tyrian archives and might be consulted by students.* (^Josephus. Ant., viii.) Hiram Abiff was also a real personage, though he did not meet his death in the manner recorded in Masonic tradition. He was a decorator rather than the actual Architect of the Temple, as the biblical records clearly tell us. “He was filled with wisdom and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass.”* (^I Kings, vii, 14.) He was “skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him”.* (^II Chron., ii, 14.)

Josephus confirms the tradition that he was an artist and a craftsman rather than an architect: “This man was skilful in all sorts of work, but his chief skill lay in working in gold and silver and brass, and he did all the curious work about the temple as the King wished.”* (^Josephus, Ant., viii.) He was the son of a widow of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass before him. Since so much responsibility rested in his hands, and he was so skilful an artist, he appears to have been in the close confidence of King Solomon, and a member of his council. He was evidently treated as an equal by the two Kings, and that is one of the reasons which influenced Bro. Ward to translate Hiram Abiff as “Hiram his father”, and to represent the King of Tyre as sending his abdicated father to superintend the decoration of the temple.

THE RECASTING OF THE RITUALS

But King Solomon’s plans for the consolidation of his people were not yet complete; by the building of his temple he had formed an outer centre of national worship, and he now desired that the Mysteries, the heart of his people's religion and the centre of their spiritual consciousness, should also be purely Jewish in their form. The ceremonial handed down from the days of Moses was still Egyptian, and the initiates of the mysteries were yet symbolically engaged in building the great pyramid, the House of Light, and in celebrating the death and resurrection of Osiris. Even though it had no corresponding halls of initiation, King Solomon desired that for the future his temple should take the place of the House of Light, and become the spiritual centre of the Jewish Mysteries. King Hiram of Tyre warmly supported this idea; he himself had inherited initiatory rites which had been derived from the Mysteries of Chaldaea, a very ancient line of tradition running parallel with the Mysteries of Egypt from Atlantean days, and having its own chief halls of initiation in Babylon. He, too, felt that a centre nearer home and in friendly hands was eminently desirable, and he therefore co-operated in the plan of Judaizing the ancient rites and focusing them upon the temple in Jerusalem.

At first, it appears, the two Kings sent an embassy to Egypt to consult the Pharaoh in the matter, telling him of the temple which they had built, and asking for some recognition of the Jewish branch of the Mysteries. The Pharaoh did not accept their proposals with any degree of enthusiasm, but rather implied that no foreigner could possibly understand the Mysteries of Egypt. The Egyptians of the period seem to have regarded their Jewish brethren with something of the same feeling that the Grand Lodge of England might have towards the Grand Orient of Hayti if it should propose alterations in the ritual, and their interest in the new venture was decidedly cold. We find no confirmation of the story of the marriage of King Solomon to Pharaoh’s daughter, as is related in the Bible; indeed, this union is now generally rejected by the critics as impossible, for according to the Tell el-Amarna tablets, an Egyptian princess might not marry a foreigner.* (^Peake’s Commentary on the Bible, p. 296.)

THE MINGLING OF TRADITIONS

On the return of their embassy from Egypt King Solomon and King Hiram called together the council at Jerusalem, and it was decided that they should proceed immediately with the work of recasting the rituals into the Jewish form. It is an interesting fact that three distinct lines of tradition were represented in the persons of the three chief members of the council, and of each of these we can find traces in our modern workings. King Solomon himself had inherited the Egyptian line of succession derived from Moses; King Hiram of Tyre preserved the Chaldaean descent; while Hiram Abiff brought with him another line of tradition, not derived from either of these sources.

This last line was strange and terrible - a line probably perpetuated through savage and primitive tribes who had bloodthirsty customs of mutilation and human sacrifice. I think it must be to this line that Bro. Ward refers in his remarkable work Who was Hiram Abiff? in which he adduces a vast amount of evidence to show that our traditional history is based upon the myth of the death and resurrection of Tammuz, and is in reality an account of the ritual murder of one of the Priest-Kings of that religion. He points out that most primitive races enact a drama in which some one, usually a priest or king, represents a god who is slain and comes to life again; that in earlier times at any rate such a representative was really killed and offered up as a sacrifice to ensure fertility; that we first hear of this myth of Tammuz in connection with Babylon, and that the tribes in the neighbourhood of Judaea were all addicted to the worship of that deity. In fact, among the Jews themselves we find the prophets blaming the Hebrew ladies for taking part in the ritual mourning for him.* (^Ezekiel, viii, 14.)

Solomon himself was by no means definitely monotheistic, and his people betrayed a distinct tendency to run after strange gods. There seems much evidence to prove that the love-song attributed to him in the Bible is really a ritual hymn to Astarte, for whom he built a temple quite near to that of Jehovah. There is considerable uncertainty as to whether Balkis, Queen of Sheba, was a real person, or only a personification of Astarte. Bro. Ward explains that the festivals of the two patron saints of Freemasonry, S. John the Baptist in summer and S. John the Evangelist in winter, are only a perpetuation of the feasts of the old fertility cult at the summer and winter solstices; that similar cultural rites are found in other lands, Teutonic, Celtic and Greek, that they also survived among the Essenes, and that the Knights Templars brought back from Syria a story very similar to that of the 3°. The tale of Jonah, he remarks, has always been understood as a myth of death and resurrection, and he also was sacrificed to appease a deity, and obtain salvation for others, just as was the Priest-King of old. He quotes many instances of foundation and consecration sacrifices; and, holding as he does that Hiram Abiff was the father of that other Hiram who was King of Tyre, he writes:

The Phoenician and Jewish followers of the old Tammuz cult no doubt felt that the Great Goddess had been cheated of her just dues when Hiram Abiff was not slain, according to ancient custom, on the accession of his son, and were confident that if he were not sacrificed when the temple was completed, its future and stability would be endangered. … So I consider that the Phoenician workmen, with or without the consent of Solomon, killed the old King of Tyre, Abibaal or Hiram Abiff, as a Consecration Sacrifice.* (^Who was Hiram Abiff? by J.S.M. Ward, p. 191.)

While we can hardly accept the suggestion that the ancestry of our modern rite is wholly Syrian, we cannot doubt that the influence of the third line of tradition especially contributed by Hiram Abiff was very considerable. We note also that it seems to have been especially concerned with the working of metals.

All that is found in our modern rituals about Lamech and his sons, about Jubal, the founder of the art of music, and Tubal Cain, the first artificer in metals, appears to belong to the line of tradition which Hiram Abiff introduced.

This council was the originator of the greater part of our modern Masonic working; the main outline of the Egyptian ritual was carefully preserved (although King Solomon on more than one occasion referred to his brother of Tyre on points of detail) together with the s … s, and although the w … s were given in Hebrew, for the most part their meaning remained the same. King Solomon himself seems to have been largely responsible for our ceremony of raising; he it was who, at the instance of Hiram Abiff, changed the legend of Osiris into that of the master builder who attempted to escape by the S., N., and E. g … s and was s … n because he would not divulge the s … s of a M.M. The name of the original master builder was not of course given as now, for he himself assisted in the construction of the legend; neither was there any fatality connected with the actual building of the holy temple. The insertion of the present name was the work of Rehoboam, when he succeeded to the throne of Solomon his father, as I have said in The Hidden Life in Freemasonry; so the story came to be applied to the person of Hiram, the widow’s son.

A very curious tradition still exists in the 3° of the rite of Mizraim. In that rite the central figure of the legend is not H.A., who is said to have returned to his family after the completion of the temple; but the story is carried back to the days of Lamech, whose son Jubal, under the name of Harrio-Jubal-Abi, is reported to have been slain by three traitors, Hagava, Hakina, and Heremda. (Mackey’s Encyclopaedia, art. Mizraim.) The rite of Mizraim, as we shall see later, is extremely old, and may well have incorporated another tradition than that handed down in Europe; for it appears to have been introduced from the East towards the end of the eighteenth century. It may be that we have here another echo of that line of tradition which Hiram Abiff represented on the council of King Solomon.

Such was the important work undertaken by the second or Sacred Lodge. The succession of I.M.s was handed down into the new dispensation, and thenceforward Masters of Lodges deriving their succession from the Mysteries of the Hebrews have always sat in the Chair of King Solomon, while the two Wardens occupy those of Hiram King of Tyre and Hiram Abiff. Thus there is a very real truth behind our Masonic tradition.

The original traditional history as adapted by King Solomon contained much more of the legend of Osiris, and was altogether more coherent and reasonable than it is to-day; for there was a resurrection of the master-builder as well as a death, and the search of Isis for the body of Osiris was reflected in the search of certain craftsmen for the body of the Master. But this was rather in the nature of a verbal charge than apiece of ritual working, and it was therefore more likely to become distorted in the course of ages. This is exactly what took place. The ceremonies were handed down from age to age with very few changes, but they were at several epochs clothed in a new set of words, which reflected the spirit of the times; while the legend associated with the ritual of the 3° became sadly marred in its passage throughout the centuries, until in its present form it is a mere shadow of the glorious teaching of the Mysteries of Egypt from which it was derived.

THE TRANSMISSION OF THE NEW RITES

The Mysteries were transmitted from generation to generation for the next three hundred and fifty years, during the survival of the kingdom of Judah. In 586 B.C. the city of Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, and the people were led captive into Babylon. During the captivity the Mysteries were interrupted, and it does not seem probable that they were seriously worked during the fifty years of exile. Nevertheless, the succession of I.M.s remained unbroken, and when the people returned from Babylon to rebuild the temple, they also tried to reconstruct their rites of initiation.

Herein we find the facts underlying the tradition of the third or Grand and Royal Lodge; for Zerubbabel, the prince of Judah, and Jeshua, the high priest, were largely instrumental in this work of restoration and renewal. The same difficulty recurred again, for it was never allowed to write down the rituals; once more it was necessary to rely upon memory for the major part of the tradition, and only a very few could have recollected the actual workings in the days before the captivity. Nevertheless they succeeded in reconstructing the rites with tolerable accuracy, although once more the traditional history suffered distortion through being imperfectly remembered. Such is the story of that line of succession which eventually found its way into the Roman Collegia, in the first place by direct descent from the teaching of King Numa, then by the migration of the rites of Attis and Cybele to Rome about 200 B.C., and again through the medium of the returning soldiers of the armies of Vespasian and Titus. From these Collegia it has been handed down with singularly little change in essentials to our modern Lodges.

Besides the three Craft degrees which formed the main structure of the Jewish Mysteries, there were also other Masonic traditions handed down from Egypt. That which is now the Holy Royal Arch had its place in the working, while the ideas contained in what we now call the Mark degree were associated with the 2° as the Arch was with the 3°. Although in English working the period of the Arch is represented to be that of Zerubbabel and the Second Temple, the Irish Chapters refer the whole legend to the days of King Josiah, while the Royal Arch of Enoch, which differs considerably in detail, though the symbology has the same significance and purpose, is described as belonging to the time of King Solomon himself. The absence of a fixed period is noteworthy as indicating that the historical setting is only of secondary importance, and that the main purpose of the degree is to convey symbolical instruction.

THE ESSENES AND THE CHRIST

The tradition of the Mysteries was transmitted from century to century, until we find it among the Essenes, who also appear to have inherited Chaldaean rites. It was in this school that the disciple Jesus lived in preparation for His ministry, after receiving a high initiation into the true Mysteries of Egypt. The Essenes had among other Chaldaean rites inherited what was afterwards known as the Mithraic eucharist, the ceremony of bread and wine and salt, which, as we shall see later, was transmitted through the ages until it was incorporated in the modern degree of the Rose-Croix of Heredom. The consecration of those elements was and is wonderful, though there is not so full a descent of the Divine Presence as in the corresponding ritual of Amen used in ancient Egypt. It seems probable, however, that the  Lord Christ took the Mithraic supper as the basis of His holy eucharist, and while preserving the ancient symbolism of the elements changed them into His own special vehicle, symbolized as His Body and Blood - the very closest and most intimate of all the sacraments known to man.

The Mithraic eucharist brought the worshipper into close touch with the divine Life; the mystic supper of the Rose-Croix lifts the Sovereign Prince into a wonderful union with Christ, the Lord of love; in the ritual of Amen the Brn. bowed to each who had partaken of the sacrament saying, “Thou art Osiris.” The holy eucharist of the Christian Church is the last and most wonderful of all, for in it we receive Him, the Lord of Love, and the sacred Host is just as fully and perfectly His vehicle as was the body of Jesus in Palestine two thousand years ago. It seems probable that He took the existing sacrament which was regularly celebrated in the Essene community, and transfigured it into another and holier eucharist, which has become the glory of His Church from generation to generation.

KABBALISM

With the tremendous impetus given by the coming of the Lord the mysteries received a greater inspiration than had been theirs since the days of Moses. Part of the mystic teaching belonging to them later passed into writing, and in the Kabbala we find fragments of the symbolic knowledge which was once the exclusive property of the initiates. So close are the analogies between certain of the doctrines of the Kabbala and those of the earlier degrees of Masonry that it has been supposed that Kabbalistic students were responsible for the introduction of speculative Masonry into our modern Craft. The student of occultism does not hold this view, for he knows that our speculative rituals belong in substance to a far older past than the eighteenth century, and that they perpetuate the tradition of the Jews, who derived it from the Mysteries of Egypt. He sees in the literature of the Kabbala a written and exoteric portion of certain teachings belonging to the Jews, though handed down along an independent line, which may nevertheless have crossed that of our own Craft and influenced it to some extent in later days. There is much in the Kabbala which throws light upon our ceremonies and symbols, and a study of Kabbalistic Theosophy may be of both profit and interest to the Mason.

The briefest summary is all that we can attempt here.* (^See The Secret Tradition in Israel, The Secret Tradition in Freemasonry, A New Encyclopaedia, all by Bro. A. E. Waite.) The literature of the Kabbala represents a growth of many centuries under the influence of many types of thought - Jewish, Gnostic, Neo-Platonic, Greek, Arabic and even Persian - and it has never been fully translated into any European language. It consists of certain great texts written in Hebrew and Aramaic, and a mass of commentaries upon them compiled by Jews of many lands and many ages. The most important texts are the Sepher Yetzirah, which explains the mystic meanings underlying the Hebrew alphabet, and erects a vast system of mystical and occult speculation upon the combinations and permutations of the various letters; and the Sepher ha Zohar, or Book of Splendour, which is a medley of history and legend, of fable and of fact, of mysticism and fantastic speculation which, like all such literature, contains priceless gems of occult wisdom hidden in a mass of rubbish. Both these texts claim to date from the second century A.D., but in reality they were not written down until a later period, the former being completed about the tenth century, and the latter before the thirteenth. They became known to the educated people of Europe about the time when speculative Masonry was beginning to emerge into the light of day (that is during the seventeenth century) through various Latin works, the chief of which are Baron Knorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbala Denudata, the OEdipus AEgyptiacus of Athanasius Kircher, the De Arte Cabalistica of Reuchlin and a Latin translation of the Yetzirah. As Bro. A. E. Waite, our chief authority in this field, has pointed out:

The written Jewish tradition presupposes throughout a tradition which did not pass into writing. The Zohar, for example, which is its chief memorial, refers everywhere to a great body of doctrine as something perfectly well-known by the circle of initiation for which the work was alone intended.* (^Secret Tradition in Freemasonry, I, 64.)

The skeleton of this body of doctrine has reached us in the symbolism of Masonry, although along so different a line; and in the Kabbala we may find a clue to much that is obscure in our modern rituals.

THE SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE TEMPLE

Two mystical concepts found in the Zohar relate directly to our subject - the spiritualization of the temple of King Solomon, and the doctrine of the lost word, both of which have their roots in the Egyptian Mysteries, as we have already seen. King Solomon’s temple formed the physical basis for a vast structure of mystical speculation and inquiry; for its measurements and proportions were held to have a relation to those of the universe, and all the sacred objects which it contained had their macrocosmic and microcosmic interpretations. The Shekinah or divine glory which irradiated the innermost sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, was interpreted not only as the divine Presence which hallowed the visible temple, but as God immanent in His universe and indwelling in the heart of man.

Furthermore, the idea of the Jews that some day the temple should be rebuilt is itself spiritualized and transformed, and it was taken as an allegory of the attainment of divine perfection both in man and the universe. The Jews, whose rich Oriental minds delighted in  exuberant and complex allegory, conceived a veritable city of temples, of which King Solomon’s was but the symbol - temples and palaces each relating to a different aspect or plane of nature and forming an intricate system of reflections and correspondences. The prototype of all this wealth of symbolism is found in the Mysteries of Egypt, wherein the measurements of the great pyramid were studied as emblematical of the proportions of the universe, and contained vast stores of occult and astronomical lore. The Jews applied what they knew of the Egyptian system to the temple of King Solomon, reflecting the wisdom of Egypt through the lens of their own fiery and poetical temperament, whence some portion of it gradually passed on the one hand into written and exoteric literature, and on the other was handed down in the secret Lodges of Masonry.

THE LOSS OF THE DIVINE NAME

The second great doctrine of Kabbalism which concerns us here is the loss of the divine Name, or rather of the correct method of pronouncing that Name. The Jews thought of this Name as a word of four letters, J.H.V.H., which we generally read as Jehovah. The tradition relates that the Omnific Word which, being the Name of God, commanded all the creative forces of Nature, was pronounced by the high priest once a year on the day of atonement, but that after the exile the true pronunciation was lost. The consonants remained, but the vowel points essential to correct articulation had been forgotten. (The present Masoretic system of vowel points was introduced only in the tenth century A.D.) This was woven into a beautiful allegory of the descent into matter and of the fall of man; for immersed in matter as we are at our present stage of evolution, we cannot utter the word or know the divine Nature in its fullness, but can perceive only the outer shell of things, represented by the remaining consonants. And even this we do not understand, and therefore for even that much of the Divine Name a substituted secret is necessary. And so in the tradition whenever the word Yahweh occurred in the reading of the Law, the name Adonai (meaning “my Lord”) was substituted for it. (The modern word Jehovah is made by using the consonants JHVH, and intercalating the vowels from the word Adonai.) The tradition looks forward to a future when time or circumstances shall have restored the genuine method of pronunciation, and man will return to the God from whom he came forth, able to utter the word in all its mighty power, to command the forces latent in his own divinity.

All this was interwoven with the doctrine of the Logos, the Word of God, expounded so admirably by Philo, and known to all Christians from the opening words of the Gospel of S. John; for the whole tradition of the divine Word is derived from the Mysteries of Egypt. The true Tetragrammaton was not the Name of God in Hebrew, but another and far more ancient word, which has ever been known to initiates of high degree. A Christian development of this symbolism forms the device of a jewel worn by a certain high official in the Scottish Rite.  Under the old covenant the word was lost, and even when restored through the discovery of a certain secret vault, its true pronunciation was unknown; the end of the quest was not yet reached, though it was in sight. The new covenant added in the centre yet one letter more,  the mystic Shin, emblematical of fire and of the Spirit; and so the Word Jehovah became Jeheshua, the Name of the Christ. Which things are an allegory, for it is only by the finding of the Christ in the heart that the lost word can be rediscovered, and that very finding brings the knowledge of the true Tetragrammaton - that secret of man’s eternal being, which from the beginning has been written upon the cross of sacrifice and always kept hidden in the heart of the world among the secret things of God.

Such is a brief outline of those Jewish Mysteries, the tradition of which was carried to Rome, and thence passed down through the Collegia into the mediaeval guilds, finally emerging in the eighteenth century in the speculative rituals of the Craft degrees, in the Holy Royal Arch and the degree of Mark Master Mason, and in those other emblems and ceremonies which have been incorporated into certain of the subsidiary grades belonging in their symbolic time to the old covenant. The Jewish Mysteries are the source of our present tradition, for the three Craft degrees are, and always have been, the basis of the whole system of Masonic initiation, since they enshrine the relics of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of Egypt, which alone can be termed degrees in their original form. But before we pass on to our next link in the Masonic chain of descent - that of Rome and its Colleges - it may be well to touch upon certain of the other great Mystery-systems which were famous in the ancient world.

2      THE GREEK MYSTERIES

THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES

WE come now to the Mysteries of Greece, of which the best-known and most important in classical times were the Eleusinian. There seems to be a widely-spread delusion, the origin of which we can trace to the writings of the Christian Fathers, that the Mysteries of antiquity were kept secret because they contained much that was improper, and that would not bear the light of day. That is not so in the least, and I am in a position to bear direct testimony, having been myself an initiate of the Mysteries, that there was nothing whatever in them of an objectionable character. The teachings were all of the highest and purest nature, and they could not but benefit very greatly all who had the privilege of being initiated into them. In classical and post-classical times many of the greatest men have borne witness to their worth.  A few quotations - samples of many - will be sufficient to show this. Sophocles, the great tragic poet, says of them:

Thrice-happy are those mortals who after the contemplation of the Mysteries go down into the realms of Hades; for there they alone will possess true life: for the rest there is naught but suffering.* (^Sophocles fr. 348, quoted Foucart: Les Mysteres d’Eleusis, p. 362.)

Plato says through the mouth of Socrates in that wonderful death-scene in the Phaedo:

I fancy that those men who established the Mysteries were not unenlightened, but in reality had a hidden meaning when they said long ago, that whoever goes uninitiated and unsanctified to the other world will lie in the mire, but he who arrives there initiated and purified will dwell with the Gods.* (^Plato. Phaedo. Loeb. Edition, p. 241.)

Cicero was initiated into them and held them in the highest reverence,* (^Cic. De. Leg., II, 14.) while Proclus tells us in the last days of the pagan faith:

The most holy Rites of Eleusis vouchsafe to the Initiates enjoyment of the good offices of Kore when they shall be delivered from their bodies.* (^Proclus. Comment. in Plat. rem pub. quoted Foucart, loc. cit., p. 364.)

It is true that in the time of the decadence of Rome there were degenerate ceremonies connected with the Mysteries of Bacchus, which involved orgies of a very unpleasant character, but they were in no way connected with the original Eleusinian Mysteries, which by that time had faded almost entirely into the background.

The modern world knows little of the truth about the Greek Mysteries, for their activities and doctrines were really kept secret. Apart from the strong pressure of public opinion, which treated the slightest violation of secrecy as an act of terrible impiety, we hear of the death-penalty being inflicted in a case of the accidental intrusion of two non-initiates into the sacred enclosure at Eleusis during the celebration of the Mysteries.* (^Livy, xxxi, 14.) Very little, therefore of direct fact has reached us from pagan sources; the greater part of our information  comes from the Christian writers, Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Arnobius and others, who were engaged upon destroying as much as possible of the pagan religion, and therefore always spoke of the Mysteries in the worst possible light. Something is known of a few of the exterior tests that were applied to candidates, and of the teaching that was given through the various myths. When people outside pressed for information, and would not be put off, the officials permitted so much to be revealed.

THE ORIGIN OF THE GREEK MYSTERIES

The original founder of the Greek Mysteries was Orpheus, who was an incarnation of the same great World Teacher who had come to Egypt in 40,000 B.C. as Thoth or Hermes, to preach the doctrine of the Hidden Light. But now the method of His message was different; for it was spoken to a different race.

About 7000 B.C, He came, living chiefly in the forests, where He gathered His disciples around Him. There was no king to bid him welcome, no gorgeous court to acclaim Him. He came as a singer, wandering through the land, loving the life of Nature, her sunlit spaces and her shadowed forest retreats, averse to cities and to the crowded haunts of men. A band of disciples grew around Him, and He taught them in the glades of woodland, silent save for the singing of the birds and the sweet sounds of forest life, that seemed not to break the stillness.

He taught by song, by music, music of voice and instrument, carrying a five-stringed musical instrument, probably the origin of Apollo’s lyre, and He used a pentatonic scale. To this He sang, and wondrous was His music, the Angels drawing nigh to listen to the subtle tones; by sound He worked upon the astral and mental bodies of His disciples, purifying and expanding them; by sound He drew the subtle bodies away from the physical, and set them free in the higher worlds. His music was quite different from the sequences, repeated over and over again, by which the same result was brought about in the Rootstock of the Race, which it carried with it into India. Here He worked by melody, not by repetition of similar sounds; and the rousing of each etheric centre had its own melody, stirring it into activity. He showed His disciples living pictures, created by music, and in the Greek Mysteries this was wrought in the same way, the tradition coming down from Him. And He taught that Sound was in all things, and that if man would harmonize himself, then would the Divine Harmony manifest through him, and make all Nature glad. Thus He went through Hellas singing, and choosing here and there one who would  follow Him, and singing also for the people in other ways, weaving over Greece a network of music, which should make her children beautiful and feed the artistic genius of her land.* (^Man: Whence, How and Whither, p. 316 ff.)

This wonderful tradition of the Mysteries of Orpheus was handed down for thousands of years until in classical times we find, on the one hand the Orphic Schools, of which that of Pythagoras was a splendid offshoot, and on the other the greatest of all the Greek Mysteries, those of Eleusis, which preserved much of the ancient teaching in a ceremonial form. A relic of the tradition of Orpheus is found in the fact that the hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries was always chosen from the sacred family of the Eumolpidae, the descendants of the fabled Eumolpus, whose name meant the sweet singer; and one of the most important qualifications for the office was the possession of a beautiful and resonant voice, with which the sacred chants might be correctly intoned.* (^Les Mysteres d’Eleusis. Paul Foucart. Paris, 1914, p. 170.)

THE GODS OF GREECE

The Greek idea of worship was very different from our modern conceptions. It must not be supposed that any of the educated Greeks believed in the mythology of their religion as literal fact. Men sometimes wonder how it was possible for great nations like Rome or Greece to remain satisfied with what we commonly call their religion - a chaos of unseemly myths, many of them not even decent, describing gods and goddesses who were distinctly human in their actions and passions, and were constantly quarrelling amongst themselves. The truth is that nobody was satisfied with it, and it never was at all what we mean by a religion, though it was no doubt taken literally by some ignorant people. All cultured and thinking men took up the study of one or other of the systems of philosophy, and in many cases they were also initiates of the school of the Mysteries; it was this higher teaching that really moulded their lives, and took for them the place of what we call religion - unless, indeed, they were frankly agnostic, as are so many cultured men now. Some of these weird myths, however, were explained in the Mysteries and were seen to enshrine a hidden teaching relating to the life of the soul.

Nevertheless many of the gods of Greece were real personages, who played their parts in the lives of the people, and were channels to them of the divine blessing. The chief aspect of the outer religion of Greece was the cult of the beautiful. It was known in Greece that every true work of art radiated an atmosphere of joy and beauty; therefore the Greeks surrounded themselves and their worship with every kind of lovely thing. They knew that the gods manifested themselves through beauty, were aspects of and channels for the One Beauty; and thus they gathered streams of the divine influence around them and so outpoured blessing upon the world. The gods of Greece were not the same as those reverenced in Egypt; they represented somewhat different aspects of the one eternal God in forms suited to the development of the Celtic sub-race, which was essentially an artistic, as the Egyptians had been a scientific people. As students of the occult side of religion are aware, each sub-race has its own especial presentation of truth, its own divine forms through whom worship is offered to the Supreme; and the type of religion is formulated by the World Teacher Himself in accordance with the development and culture which are to be the distinguishing characteristic of that race and its contribution to the world-plan of evolution. In Greece, as in Egypt, there was a multiplicity of these divine forms, some of them represented and ensouled by great Angels, who may be compared to some extent to those adored in Christian lands - S. Michael, S. Gabriel, S. Raphael and others. The gods of Greece were no less real than these great ones, although they belonged to an entirely different type, resembling rather the presiding Angels of the various countries than the Rulers of the nine orders of the Angelic hosts.

Pallas Athene, the grey-eyed goddess of wisdom, was a magnificent and splendid Being, who practically governed Athens in the old days through her devotees. Her influence was enormously stimulating, but she was not so much an embodiment of compassion or of love, as is the Blessed Virgin Mary, but rather of efficiency and of that perfect accuracy of form that is the essence of all true art. Much of the wonderful art of Greece was inspired directly by her; and to satisfy her it had to be the very highest and truest and most accurate. She could not tolerate a single line misplaced, even in the smallest thing. There was something of polished steel about Athene; she was cold and keen like a rapier, tremendously powerful, keeping the people up to the highest, the noblest, the purest, the most beautiful; and yet less for the sake of an abstract love of beauty than because it would have been a disgrace to be otherwise than beautiful. There was practically no emotion connected with Pallas Athene; we had an intellectual appreciation of her greatness, an intense devotion along mental lines, a splendid enthusiasm in following her; but we should not have ventured upon anything like personal affection. She kept Athens in perfect order, directing it, governing it, brooding over its people with her wonderful inspiration; and she watched the development of her city with the closest interest, determined that it should be ahead of Sparta and Corinth and the other cities of Greece.

Hera was a real personage likewise, but very different from Pallas Athene. She was one of the many incarnations or forms of the feminine aspect of the First Ray, and was thought of as the Queen of Heaven; she corresponds most closely to the Indian goddess Parvati, the shakti or power of Shiva, imaged as His consort, as Hera was the consort of Zeus.

Dionysus was the Logos Himself, just as Osiris had been in Egypt, though in a somewhat different aspect; and the legend of His death and resurrection corresponded closely with that of Osiris, and was taught with the same signification in the Mysteries of Greece. Phoebus Apollo, the God of the Sun and of music, whose symbol was the lyre, seems originally to have been Orpheus; so that in venerating him the Greeks in reality offered their love to the great World Teacher. Demeter and her daughter Persephone or Kore were especially reverenced at Eleusis. These two deities were personifications of the great forces of nature, the first of the brooding motherhood of the earth, and the second of that creative life which makes the earth to flourish and blossom with corn and flowers and fruit, and then withdraws once more at the onset of winter into a kind of hibernation - a hidden life within, only to burst out again as though in a new incarnation under the influence of spring. Demeter appears to correspond with Uma, the Great Mother, still venerated in India.

Aphrodite, the goddess of Love - “immortal Aphrodite of the broidered throne,” as Sappho calls her - represented the feminine aspect of the Deity as the divine compassion; she was called the “foam-born” because she was mystically supposed to have risen from the waters of the ocean. Swinburne describes her in magnificent lines:

Her deep hair heavily laden with the odour and colour of

flowers,

White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a

Flame …

who, at her mystic birth,

Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her

foot on the sea.

And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the

viewless ways,

And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of

the bays.

This beautiful symbolism of her name refers to the form side of the Deity, the root of matter - called the “deep sea”, or the “virgin sea” - which is impregnated with the divine life and beauty, and so gives birth to the loveliest of forms. The title “foam-born” is particularly appropriate when we consider that all forms are built up of aggregations of bubbles blown in the “deep sea”, the aether of space. All this was explained to the initiates of the Mysteries. The same mystical idea lies in the title of Our Lady Mary, “Star of the Sea”; although she embodies in herself a fuller manifestation of the divine love in the perfection of eternal motherhood, and indeed unites in her person many Aspects of the Deity that were divided in Greece. There were, however, two sides of the cult of Aphrodite. The higher side was embodied in Aphrodite Ouranios, the heavenly Aphrodite, who was indeed “the Mother of fair love”; but there was a lower aspect of her worship as Aphrodite Pandemos, the earthly, common love, which leads to much evil and base desire, unworthy of the name love; and this aspect was the most prominent in the days when the old religion had become outworn and corrupt. Aphrodite corresponds to some extent with Lakshmi in India.

The gods were connected with the Mysteries, and worked with and through their faithful followers; but even in the Mysteries there was less of devotion and more of intellectual appreciation than in our religion to-day. In studying different branches of the Mysteries as worked in different lands we can but give certain analogies - we cannot hope to make exact comparisons; and the difficulty is still greater when we try to compare the ancient with the modern faiths - their whole outlook was so different from ours.

THE OFFICIALS

The control of the Eleusinian Mysteries in classical times lay in the hands of two families: the Eumolpidae and the Keryces or heralds, who were also connected with the worship of the Pythian Apollo at Delphi. Most of the officers were chosen from these two families, although there were also important civil representatives of the Athenian State who were responsible for the public ceremonial of the Mysteries as well as for the control of finance.

The chief officer was the hierophant, chosen for life by lot from the Eumolpidae. He alone had the guardianship of the Hallows (Hiera), those sacred treasures which were so carefully preserved at Eleusis and played so great a part in the ceremonial magic of the Mysteries. He was invariably a man of advanced age and distinguished position, and in his hands lay the supreme control over the secret ceremonial.

Next to him in rank stood the Dadouchos, the bearer of the double torch, chosen for life from the family of the Keryces. Both these officials had houses in the sacred enclosure at Eleusis, into which only initiates might enter; but while the hierophant remained in almost entire seclusion, the Dadouchos often took a prominent part in public affairs. A third official was the Hieroceryx, or sacred herald, who also was chosen for life from the family of Keryces; one of his duties was to make the solemn proclamation to the Mystae before their initiation into the Greater Mysteries, to preserve silence upon sacred matters. A fourth official was the Priest of the Altar, chosen also from the Keryces, who in later times was responsible for the sacrifices. In the great days of the Mysteries animal sacrifices were never offered, but, as in all religious systems, a time came when the tradition had become formalized and much of the inner knowledge had been withdrawn. It was then that certain teachings upon the meaning of sacrifice and its place in the spiritual life were distorted and materialized into the cruel superstition that it was necessary to sacrifice animals to the Diety.

There were also two women hierophants, dedicated to the two goddesses who presided over the Mysteries, Demeter and Kore; and in addition to them there was a priestess of Demeter, who appears to have been closely connected with certain other rites of the goddesses open only to women (Thesmophoria, Haloa), as well as with the  Mysteries of Eleusis. A number of minor officials also took part in the ceremonial. As in Egypt, women were admitted to the Mysteries on equal terms with men, and no distinction was made between the sexes save in the matter of office. The instruction of the candidates was placed in the hands of the Mystagogues, who taught under the supervision of the hierophant and prepared the initiates for the celebration of the Mysteries, communicating to them certain formulae which would be required in the course of the ceremonial. An enclosed order of priestesses lived in retreat at Eleusis, vowed to celibacy and dedicated to the higher life. It seems probable that these are the “bees” of whom Porphyry and various grammarians speak.* (^Les Mysteres d’Eleusis. Foucart, Ch. VI and VIII, passim.)

THE LESSER MYSTERIES

The Eleusinian Mysteries were divided into two degrees, the Lesser and the Greater. We see no trace of the tri-gradal system suggested by some scholars, although there were special ceremonies for the installation of the principal officers. The Lesser Mysteries were celebrated in the Temple of Demeter and Kore at Agrae, near Athens, in the month of March. In them teaching was given upon the life after death in the intermediate or astral world, just as in the Lesser Mysteries of Egypt, and in this sense it is possible to compare the Lesser Mysteries with our Masonic 1°, although the details of the ceremonial do not exactly correspond. The ceremony was conducted by the hierophant of Eleusis, assisted by his various officers; and the initiates of this degree were called mystae.

The ceremonies opened with a preliminary purification or baptism in the waters of the Ilissus, during which certain ritual formulae were recited; they were continued in the secrecy of the temple, in which representations of the astral world were shown to the candidate, and instruction given upon the results of certain courses of action in the life after death. In earlier days when the hierophant directing the studies described the effect of some particular vice or crime, he used his occult power to materialize some good example of the fate which his words portrayed, in some cases, it is stated, enabling the sufferer to speak and explain the condition in which he found himself as the outcome of his neglect while on earth of the eternal laws under which the worlds are governed. Sometimes, instead of this, a vivid image of the state of some victim of his own folly would be materialized for the instruction of the neophytes.

In the days of the decadence, just as in Egypt, there remained no hierophant who possessed the power to produce these occult illustrations, and consequently their place was taken by actors dressed to represent the sufferers, and in some cases by ghostly images projected by  means of concave mirrors - or even by cleverly executed statuary or mechanical figures. Of course it was perfectly understood by all concerned that these were only representations, and no one was ever led to suppose that they were original cases. Certain of our ecclesiastical writers, however, failed to realize this, and some of them spent much time and ingenuity in “exposing” deceptions which never deceived anyone, least of all those who were specially concerned with them. Besides this teaching upon the exact results in astral life of physical thought and action, much instruction was given in cosmogony, and the evolution of man on this earth was fully explained, again with the aid of illustrative scenes and figures, produced at first by materialization, but later imitated in various ways.

The initiates of the Mysteries had a number of proverbs and aphorisms peculiar to themselves. “Death is life, and life is death” was a saying which will need no interpretation for the student of the inner side of life, who comprehends; at least to some extent, how infinitely more real and vivid is life on any other plane than this imprisonment in the flesh. “Whosoever pursues realities during this life will pursue them after death; whosoever pursues unrealities during this life will pursue them also after death,” was another statement entirely in line with the facts of post-mortem existence, and it emphasizes the great truth upon which we so often find it necessary to insist, that death in no way changes the real man, but that his disposition and his mode of thought remain exactly what they were before.

The myths of the exoteric religion of the country were taken up and studied in the Eleusinian Mysteries, as in the Mysteries of Egypt. Among those relating to the life after death was that of Tantalus, who was condemned to suffer perpetual thirst in Hades: water surrounded him on all sides, but receded from him whenever he attempted to drink; over his head hung branches of fruit which receded in like manner when he stretched out his hand to touch them. This was interpreted to mean that everyone who dies full of sensual desire of any kind finds  himself after death still full of desire, but unable to gratify it.

Another story was that of Sisyphus, who was condemned always to roll uphill a huge block of marble, which as soon as it reached the top rolled down again. That represents the condition after death of a man full of personal ambition, who has spent his life in making plans for selfish ends. In the other world he goes on making plans and working them out, but always finds at the point of completion that they are nothing but a dream. The liver of Tityus was ceaselessly devoured by vultures. This was symbolical of the raging desire that tears at a man until it is burnt out by suffering. In many such ways desire is purified and the man is able to pass onwards to the life of the heaven-world, which was the subject of instruction in the Greater Mysteries.

Within the Lesser Mysteries, just as in the Mysteries of Egypt, there existed an inner school for the training of specially selected candidates. These were taught to awaken the senses of the astral plane, so that the teaching given in the Mysteries could be verified by them at first hand. As in Egypt, the severe tests of courage were applied only to the small proportion of those who entered the Mysteries who intended to take up positive occult training, and become active workers on the astral and higher planes. Tens of thousands of people were initiated without them. One classical author mentions a gathering of thirty thousand initiates. All serious-minded people gravitated towards these Mysteries, much as the better class of young men and women of our day go to the great Universities, and in addition many were interested in one or other of the systems of philosophy.

This inner school was kept secret, so that none even of the initiates knew of its existence until actually received into it. The dress of the mystae was the dappled fawn-skin (Nebris),* (^Recherches sur les Mysteres du Paganisme. Par M. le Baron de Sainte-Croix. Ed., Paris, 1817. Tome I, p. 347.) a fitting emblem of the uncontrolled astral body, which in this 1° had to be trained and brought into subjection by the will. This dress corresponded with the leopard-skin worn by the Egyptian priests, and the tiger or antelope skin so often used by the Eastern Yogis.

THE GREATER MYSTERIES

The Greater Mysteries were held at Eleusis in the month of September (Boedromion), and in connection with their celebration all Greece went into holiday, and splendid public processions took place, in which the whole populace, both initiates and non-initiates, joined. These public processions have been described in detail by contemporary writers; but beyond these exoteric descriptions nothing of the Greater Mysteries is known to the outer world save through a few obscure hints. On the 13th Boedromion the young men gathered at Eleusis to form the escort of the solemn procession to Athens, which was distant from Eleusis some twelve miles. On the 14th the Hallows (Hiera) were solemnly escorted to the great city, accompanied by the hierophant and his officers, the members of the priestly families, the college of priestesses and the retinue of the Eleusinian temple. The Hallows were treated with the deepest reverence; they were conveyed in great wicker baskets secured with bands of purple wool, and placed upon a ceremonial car. Only the hierophant and his ministers were allowed to handle them, and none but initiates might even see them, under pain of death. During the rest of the year they remained in a shrine or chapel (Anactoron) in the temple at Eleusis, and were guarded with the utmost care and awe, as being of divine origin.

When the procession reached the outskirts of the city of Athens, the Hallows were met by the magistrates and people, and were escorted with all magnificence and pomp to the Eleusinion at the foot of the Acropolis. Like the mother temple at Eleusis, this was surrounded by high walls, and no one but the initiates was ever allowed to enter. On the 15th day of the month, the day of the full moon, the mystae who were to be advanced to the Greater Mysteries assembled, and the solemn proclamation was made, enumerating those to whom access to the Mysteries was forbidden … “Whoso hath unclean hands … whoso hath an unintelligible voice”.* (^Libanius, quoted Foucart. op. cit., p. 311.) This latter qualification has been taken to mean that only Greek-speaking people could be admitted to the Mysteries; but M. Foucart suggests the more probable explanation that the voice must be free from impediment in order that the sacred formulae might be pronounced correctly; and he compares this qualification to the Egyptian title Maat-heru, which meant not only “true of voice” but one who is able to wield the occult powers of sound without mistake.* (^Ibid., p. 149.) When we remember the tradition of Orpheus and realize how great a part sound played in the Greek Mysteries, we may understand that this conjecture is not without foundation.

On the 16th day of the month the mystae took a ceremonial bath of purification in the sea; on the 17th and 18th various public processions took place in Athens; while the mystae remained secluded in the temple, receiving instruction and preparing themselves by meditation for their initiation into the Greater Mysteries. On the 19th the great procession of the initiates to Eleusis was formed, the Hallows were carried back to their ancient resting-place with the fullest possible pomp and splendour, and the candidates and Brn. marched in triumph to the temple of initiation accompanied by vast crowds of people.

First came the car of Iacchos, bearing the statue of “the fair young God”, who was one of the forms of Dionysus, the “Blazing Star of nocturnal Initiation” as Aristophanes calls him;* (^Aristophanes. Frogs, 346.) next marched the young men, myrtle-crowned, with shields and lances glittering in the sunlight, whose duty and privilege it was to escort the sacred Hallows, borne aloft upon the ceremonial car in the great wicker baskets, still bound with purple wool; after them came the hierophant and his officers, dressed in their purple robes and wearing myrtle crowns, followed by the mystae in charge of the mystagogues. After them marched the vast company of initiates and people, arranged according to their tribes and demes, and preceded by the civil magistrates and the council of the five hundred; and the whole splendid throng was followed by a train of baggage-animals carrying bedding and provisions for the few days’ sojourn at Eleusis.

The procession arrived at the sacred village after nightfall, and glowed like a river of fire in the blazing light of the torches carried by all the people; and after a tremendous ovation the Hallows were carried into the sacred enclosure by the hierophant, who placed them once more in the secret shrine within the hall of initiation (Telesterion). The next two days, during which the actual ceremonial instruction took place, were spent by the initiates within the enclosing walls of the temple, and the whole glorious celebration concluded with a festal  assembly held outside the temple walls, in which all the citizens took part, afterwards returning quietly to their homes.* (^Les Mysteres d’Eleusis. Ch. XI and XII, passim.)

In the Greater Mysteries the teaching upon the life after death was extended to the heaven-world; they thus corresponded to some extent to our 2°. The initiates were named epoptae, and their ceremonial garment was no longer a fawn-skin, but a golden fleece - whence, naturally, the whole myth of Jason and his companions. This symbolized the mental body, and the power definitely to function in it. Those who have seen the splendid radiance of all which pertains to that mental plane, who have noticed the innumerable vortices produced by the ceaseless emission and impact of thought-forms, who remember that a brilliant yellow is especially the colour which manifests intellectual activity, will acknowledge that this was no inapt representation.

In this class, as in the lower one, there were two types - those who could be taught to use the mental body, and to form round it the strong temporary vehicle of astral matter which has sometimes been called the mayavi rupa - and the far greater majority who were not yet prepared for this development, but could nevertheless be instructed with regard to the mental plane and the powers and faculties appropriate to it. As in the Lesser Mysteries men learned the exact result in the intermediate world after death of certain actions and modes of life on the physical plane, so in the Greater Mysteries they learnt how causes generated in this lower existence worked out in the heaven-world. In the Lesser the necessity and the method of the control of desires, passions and emotions was made clear; in the Greater the same teaching was given with regard to the control of mind.

Further teaching upon cosmogenesis and anthropogenesis was also continued. In the Greater Mysteries instead of being instructed only as to the broad outlines of evolution by reincarnation (which does not appear to have been clearly taught in the outer religion), and the previous races of mankind, the initiates now received a description of the whole scheme as we have it to-day, including the seven great chains of worlds and their positions in the solar system as a whole. Their terms were different from ours, but the instruction was in essence the same; where we speak of successive life-waves and outpourings, they spoke of aeons and emanations, but there is no doubt that they were fully in touch with the facts, and that they represented them to their pupils in wonderful visions of cosmic processes and their terrestrial analogies.

Just as in the case of the after-death states, these representations were at first produced by occult methods; and later, when these failed them, by mechanical and pictorial means, the results of which were greatly inferior. Illustrations of the development of the human embryo, shown by picture or model in the same way as we might show some of them by means of a microscope, were employed to teach by the law of correspondences the truth of cosmic evolution. We may remember how Madame Blavatsky adopted in The Secret Doctrine a similar method of illustrating the same evolutionary processes.* (^Op. cit., Vol. iii, p. 441.) It is probable that a misunderstanding of the representation of some of these processes of reproduction was distorted into an idea of indecency, and so the seed was sown from which sprang later the false and foolish accusations of the ignorant and bigoted Christians.

The culmination of the ceremonial of the Greater Mysteries was the exposition of an ear of corn. Of this Hippolytus speaks:

The Athenians, while initiating people into the Eleusinian Rites, likewise display to those who are being admitted to the highest grade at these Mysteries, the mighty, marvellous, and most perfect secret suitable for one initiated into the highest mystic truths: I allude to an ear of corn in silence reaped. This ear of corn is also considered among the Athenians to constitute the perfect and enormous illumination that has descended from the unportrayable One, just as the hierophant himself declares.* (^Hippolytus. Refutation of All Heresies, Bk. V, iii (Ante-Nicene Library Ed.))

This symbol referred to the divine life of God, ever-changing, ever-renewed, buried in the earth of the lower planes, only to rise in other forms to a fuller and more abundant life, passing from manifestation to manifestation without end. This was explained by the hierophant to the initiates, and the simplicity of the symbol and the beauty and profundity of the meaning underlying it formed a fitting climax to a wonderful ceremony.

THE MYTHS OF THE GREATER MYSTERIES

The meaning of various myths was explained in detail in the instruction given to the initiates. The legend of Persephone or Proserpine (Kore) is clearly an occult parable of the descent of the soul into matter. If we remember how the story tells us that Proserpine was carried away while she was plucking the flower of the narcissus, at once we have a suggestion of connection with that other myth of the soul’s life. Narcissus is represented to have been a young man of extraordinary beauty who fell in love with his own reflection in a pool of water, and was so much attracted by it that he fell into the pool and was drowned, and was afterwards changed by the gods into a beautiful flower. It was taught that the soul was not originally immersed in matter, and need not have been so, but for the fact that she was attracted by the image of herself in the lower conditions of matter, symbolized by water.  Beguiled by this reflection, she identifies herself with the lower personality, and is for the time sunk altogether in matter; yet nevertheless the divine seed remains, and presently she springs up again as a flower. It was while Proserpine was stooping to Narcissus that she was seized and carried off by Desire, who is the king of the lower world; and although she was rescued from complete captivity by the effort of her mother, yet after that she had to spend her life half in the lower world, and half in that above, that is to say, partly in incarnation and partly out of it.

The Minotaur, which was slain by Theseus, was the personality in man, “half animal and half man”. Theseus typifies the higher self, who has been gradually developing and gathering strength until at last he can wield the sword of his divine father, the Spirit. Guided through the labyrinth of illusion which constitutes these lower planes by the  thread of occult knowledge given him by Ariadne (who represents intuition), the higher self is enabled to slay the lower and escape safely from the web of illusion; yet there still remains for him the danger that, developing intellectual pride, he may neglect intuition, even as Theseus neglected Ariadne, and so failed for the time to reach his highest possibilities. The legend of the slaying of Bacchus by the Titans, the tearing of his body into fragments and his resurrection from the dead, was also taught, with the same interpretation as that given to the legend of Osiris in the Mysteries of Egypt - the descent of the One to become the many, and the reunion of the many in the One through suffering and sacrifice.

THE MAGIC OF THE GREATER MYSTERIES

In the Eleusinian Mysteries the initiates were brought into close communion with the Deity through specially consecrated food and drink. Cups of highly-magnetized water were given to them, and consecrated cakes were eaten during the ceremonies of initiation. S. Clement of Alexandria gives us the formula or pass-word of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which some have taken to refer to this sacrament: “I fasted; I drank the draught; I took from the chest; having tasted, I placed in the basket, and from the basket into the chest.”* (^Clem, Alex. Exhortation to the Greeks. Loeb. Ed., p. 43 (Lobeck.))  In many religions we find a similar method of conveying the divine blessing to the people.

The Hallows (Hiera) already mentioned were physical objects extremely highly magnetized, through which much of the magical side of the Mysteries was performed. They were the personal property of the priestly family of the Eumolpidae, being handed down from generation to generation; and their solemn exposition and the explanation of the symbolical teaching connected with them was one of the features of the Eleusinian ritual.* (^Foucart. Op. cit., p. 150.)

One of these was the caduceus, the rod of power, surrounded by the twisting serpents and surmounted by the pine-cone. It was the same as the thyrsus; and was said to be hollow and to be filled with fire. In India it is a stick of bamboo with seven knots in it, which represents the spinal column with its seven centres or chakras. When a candidate had been initiated, he was often described as one who had been touched with the thyrsus, showing that it was not a mere emblem, but had also a practical use. It also indicated the spinal cord, ending in the medulla, while the serpents were symbolical of the two channels called in Eastern terminology Ida and Pingala; and the fire enclosed within it was the serpent-fire which in Sanskrit is called kundalini. It was laid by the hierophant against the back of the candidate, and thus used as a strong magnetic instrument in order to awaken the forces latent within him, and to free the astral body from the physical, so that the candidate might pass in full consciousness to the higher planes. To help him in the efforts that lay before him the priest in this way gave the aspirant some of his own magnetism. This rod of power was of the greatest importance, and we can understand why it was regarded with so much awe when we realize something of its occult potency.

There was also the krater or cup, always associated with Dionysus, and emblematical of the causal body of man, which has ever been symbolized by a cup filled with the wine of the divine life and love. The tradition of this passed down through the ages and became mingled with that of the Holy Grail, which played so great a part in early mediaeval romance and legend.

Among the holy symbols there were also highly-magnetized and richly jewelled statues, which had been handed down from a remote past, and were the physical basis of certain great forces invoked in the Mysteries; and a lyre, reputed to be the lyre of Orpheus, on which certain melodies were played and to which the sacred chants were sung. There were also the toys of Bacchus, with which he was playing when he was seized by the Titans and torn to pieces - very remarkable toys, full of significance. The dice with which he plays are the five Platonic solids, the only regular polygons possible in geometry. They are given in a fixed series, and this series agrees with the different planes of the solar system. Each of them indicates, not the form of the atoms of the different planes, but the lines along which the power works which surrounds those atoms. Those polygons are the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. If we put the point at one end and the sphere at the other we have a set of seven figures, corresponding to the number of planes in our solar system.

In some of the older schools of philosophy it was said: “No one can enter who does not know mathematics.” That meant not what we now call mathematics, but that science which embraces the knowledge of the higher planes, of their mutual relations, and the way in which the whole is built by the will of God. When Plato said: “God geometrizes,” he stated a profound truth which throws much light upon the methods and mysteries of evolution. Those forms are not conceptions of the human brain; they are truths of the higher planes. We have formed the habit of studying the books of Euclid, but we study them now for themselves, and not as a guide to something higher. The old philosophers pondered upon them because they led to the understanding of the true science of life.

Another toy with which Bacchus played was a top, the symbol of the whirling atom pictured in Occult Chemistry. Yet another was a ball which represented the earth, that particular part of the planetary chain to which the thought of the Logos is specially directed at the moment. Also he played with a mirror. The mirror has always been a symbol of the astral light, in which the archetypal ideas are reflected and then materialized. Thus each of those toys indicates an essential part in the evolution of a solar system.

THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES

The two divisions of the lesser and greater mysteries above-mentioned were generally known, but it was not known that there was always, behind and above those, the greater mystery of the Path of Holiness, the steps of which are the five great Initiations already mentioned. The very existence of the possibility of that future advancement was not certainly known even by the initiates of the Greater Mysteries until they were actually fit to receive the mystic summons from within. If one thinks of the conditions of that time one can readily understand the reason for that secrecy. The Roman Emperors, for example, knew of the existence of the Lesser and the Greater Mysteries, and insisted upon being initiated into them. We know from history that many of the Emperors were hardly of a character to be allowed to play a leading role in a religious body, but it would have been very difficult for the hierophants of the Mysteries to refuse entrance to an Emperor of Rome. As was once said: “One cannot argue with the, master of thirty legions.” Many of the Emperors would certainly have killed anyone who stood in the way of anything they wished; so the existence of the true Mysteries was not made public; and no one knew of them until he was deemed, by those who could judge, worthy to be admitted into them. The teaching of these higher degrees is still open to the worthy, and to the worthy alone; but certain conditions must be fulfilled, as I have explained in The Masters and the Path.

Thus the Mysteries of Eleusis corresponded closely with those of Egypt, though they differed in detail; and both these systems led their initiates, when properly prepared, to that Wisdom of God which was “before the beginning of the world”. We in Masonry do not inherit the Eleusinian succession directly, although something of its inspiration and influence was transmitted to certain of the mystic schools of the Middle Ages. Nevertheless our rites have the same purpose, symbolize the same invisible worlds, and are intended to prepare candidates for the same august reality that lies behind all true systems of the Mysteries alike.

THE SCHOOL OF PYTHAGORAS

The great philosopher Pythagoras was born in Samos about 582 B.C., and was the founder of the school that bore his name and studied his teachings in Greece, Italy, Egypt and Asia Minor. Mr. G. R. S. Mead says of the Pythagorean school:

The finest characters among women with which ancient Greece presents us were formed in the School of Pythagoras, and the same is true of the men. The authors of antiquity are agreed that this discipline had succeeded in producing the highest examples not only of the purest chastity and sentiment; but also a simplicity of manners, a delicacy and a taste for serious pursuits which was unparalleled.* (^Orpheus: G.R.S. Mead, p. 265, 266.)

Pythagoras travelled through many of the countries of the Mediterranean basin, studying for some years in Egypt, where he was initiated at Sais. He was also initiated into the Eleusinian, Kabeiric and Chaldaean Mysteries, and thus was thoroughly versed in all the hidden knowledge of the ancient world. In addition to his travels round the shores of the Mediterranean, Pythagoras journeyed to India, where he met the Lord Buddha and became one of His disciples. He spent some years in India, and it is reported that he had the high honour of an interview with the next World Teacher, the holy Child Shri Krishna, who blessed him and sent him back to Europe to found his system of philosophy and of esoteric instruction. Thus in the Pythagorean school many lines of tradition met together, and were blended into a comprehensive teaching upon the hidden side of life.

There is a curious old writing called the Leyland-Locke MS., which was at one time in the Bodleian Library, but recent investigators have been unable to trace it. Its genuineness has been disputed by some authorities, “but,” says Bro. Ward, “in my opinion on quite inadequate grounds.”* (^An Outline History of Freemasonry, by J.S.M. Ward, p. 24.) Its reputed date is 1436, and it is written in the quaint old English of the period, and in the form of question and answer. In the part referring to Freemasonry it asks where it began, and the answer is that it began with the first men of the East, who were before the first men of the West. Then it asks who brought it to the West and the answer is: “The Venetians, etc.”

It then continues:

How comede ytt (Freemasonry) yn Engelonde?

Peter Gower, a Grecian, journeyed for kunnynge yn Egypte and yn Syria, and yn everyche londe whereat the Venetians hadde plauntedde Maconrye, and wynnynge entraunce yn al Lodges of Maconnes, he learned muche, and retournedde and worked yn Grecia Magna wachsynge and becommynge a myghtye wysacre and gratelyche renowned, and here he framed a grate Lodge at Groton, and maked many Maconnes, some whereoffe dyd journeye yn Fraunce, and maked manye Maconnes wherefromme, yn process of tyme, the arte passed yn Engelonde.

This is said to have much puzzled John Locke until he realized that Peter Gower was Pitagore - the French pronunciation of Pythagoras, that Groton was Crotona, and the Venetians the Phoenicians.

No wonder that Mackey says: “It is not singular that the old Masons should have called Pythagoras their ‘ancient friend and brother’.” About 529 B.C. Pythagoras settled in Crotona in the south of Italy, remaining there until he was forced by political troubles to remove to Metapontum. At Crotona he became the centre of a widespread and influential organization, a religious brotherhood which extended over all the Greek-speaking world. “Number is great and perfect and omnipotent, and the principle and guide of divine and human life,” said Philolaus, and the sentence expresses the keynote of the Pythagorean system. Number is order and limitation, and alone makes a cosmos possible. By numbers nature moves, and to understand numbers is to be the master of nature. Hence the Pythagorean sought to understand the nature of numbers, and to trace their working in the universe, whether in the vast ordered movements in the heavens, or in the arrangements of the earth. Hence also his devotion to mathematics, a science which (as far as Europe is concerned) may almost be said to have been created by Pythagoras, so much did he add to it and systematize it; he found it but a number of scattered and  unrelated facts, and left it a science. Metempsychosis or reincarnation was an essential part of the Pythagorean teaching; the purification of the soul being thus accomplished by repeated descents into matter and withdrawals into the invisible worlds, in order to transmute experience into faculty.

THE THREE DEGREES

The Pythagorean schools worked in close association with the teaching of the Mysteries, but without the ceremonies; they gave a philosophical exposition of the same great facts of the inner worlds. In those schools the pupils were divided into three degrees which corresponded almost exactly with those of the early Christians, who called them the stages of purification, illumination and perfection respectively - the last one including what S. Clement of Alexandria calls the “scientific knowledge of God”. In the Pythagorean scheme the first degree was that of the akoustikoi or hearers, who took no part in the discussions or addresses, but kept absolute silence in the meetings for two years, and devoted themselves to listening and learning.

At the end of that time, if otherwise satisfactory, the students were eligible for the second degree, that of the mathematikoi. The mathematics which they learnt were not, however, confined to what we now mean by that term. We study this science as an end in itself, but for them it was only a preparation for something much wider, higher and more practical. Geometry, as we now know it, was taught in the outer world in ordinary life as a preparation; but inside these great schools the subject was carried much farther, to the study and comprehension of the fourth dimension, and the laws and properties of higher space. It can be fully understood only if we take it thus as a whole, not in mere fragments, and as an introduction to higher development. It leads a man upwards towards the understanding of all the octaves of vibrations, as to vast areas of which science knows nothing as yet, towards the intricate occult relations of numbers, colours and sounds, the various three-dimensional sections of the mighty cone of space, and the true shape of the universe. There is a vast amount to be gained from the study of mathematics by those who know how to take it up in the right way; it helps us to see how the worlds are made.

The mathematikoi brought geometry, mathematics and music into relation with one another, and worked out the correspondences between them, which are very remarkable. Everyone who knows anything about music is aware that there is a fixed proportion between the lengths of the strings which produce certain tones. A piano can be tuned according to a certain system of fifths, and the relation of the different tones to one another can be expressed by the number of vibrations of each tone; so a harmonious chord can be stated mathematically. This was first discovered simply by experiment; later the mathematicians found out what the proportions should be, and again by experiment they were found to be exact. But the peculiarity is that the numbers which produce a harmonious chord have the same relation to one another as that which exists between certain parts of the Platonic solids. Our scale, so different from the old Greek scale, which consisted of five tones, can still be deduced from the proportions of those five Platonic figures, which were studied over two thousand years ago in Greece. One might think that there cannot be much relation between mathematics and music, but we see by this that they are both parts of one great whole.

The third degree of the Pythagoreans was that of the physikoi - not physicists in our modern sense of the word, but students of the true inner life, who learnt how to distinguish the divine life under all its disguises, and so were able to comprehend the course of its evolution. The life exacted from all these pupils was of the most exalted purity. Mackey gives the following account of the school at Crotona:

The disciples of this school wore the simplest kind of clothing, and, having on their entrance surrendered all their possessions to the common fund, they submitted for three* (^This should be two only.) years to voluntary poverty, during which time they were also compelled to a rigorous silence. The scholars were divided into Exoterics and Esoterics. This distinction was borrowed by Pythagoras from the Egyptian priests, who practised a similar mode of instruction. The exoteric scholars were those who attended the public assemblies, where general ethical instructions were delivered by the sage. But only the esoterics constituted the true school, and these alone Pythagoras called, says Iamblichus, his companions and friends. Before admission to the privileges of the school, the previous life and character of the candidate were rigidly scrutinized, and in the preparatory initiation secrecy was enjoined by an oath, and the severest trials of his fortitude and self-command were imposed. The brethren, about six hundred in number, with their wives and children, resided in one large building. Every morning the business and duties of the day were arranged, and at night an account was rendered of the day’s transactions. They arose before day to pay their devotions to the sun, and recited verses from Homer, Hesiod, or some other poet. Several hours were spent in study, after which there was an interval before dinner, which was occupied in walking and in gymnastic exercises. The meals consisted principally of bread and honey.

Although we do not find any direct connection between the School of Pythagoras and the degrees of modern Masonry, yet the influence of Pythagoras upon our Mysteries was profound, as Masons have always recognized. The tradition of the Pythagoreans passed into the Neo-Platonic schools; and from thence much of the inner teaching came into Christian hands, and formed the basis of many of those schools of mystic instruction which enshrined in mediaeval times certain of the secrets now preserved in the higher degrees of Masonry.  There is a succession of ideas as well as of sacramental power; and the school of Pythagoras may certainly be said to be one of the links in the chain of Masonic philosophy, even though to-day the greater part of that philosophy has faded from our rites. To Pythagoras is attributed the discovery of the 47th proposition of Euclid, which now forms the jewel of the I.P.M. in English Masonry, and is the basis not only of a great portion of exoteric geometry but, in a mystical sense, of the whole system of the Mysteries, and indeed of the universe itself. It is impossible exactly to estimate the influence of any given line of tradition. We cannot say more than that some of the Pythagorean teachings, probably transmitted along several mutually-interacting lines of descent, became mingled with the Masonry of the Middle Ages and formed part of the inner instruction that was associated with the ceremonies handed down among the operative builders from Jewish sources. These were preserved under binding pledges of secrecy, and emerged in speculative Masonry after the Reformation, thus forming part of our present Masonic system.

OTHER GREEK MYSTERIES

Another line of tradition is that of the Mysteries of Dionysus (or as the Romans called him, Bacchus), which approached more closely to the Egyptian scheme of initiation than the Eleusinian rites. They were celebrated throughout Greece and Asia Minor, but principally at Athens; they were carried to Rome, and afterwards formed a link in the chain of Masonic descent. Their central legend deals with the slaying of Dionysus by the Titans and his subsequent resurrection.

The mysteries commenced with the consecration of an egg, symbolizing the mundane egg from which all things came. The candidate was crowned with myrtle, clothed in the sacred robes, exhorted to have courage, and then led through dark caverns amid the howling of wild beasts and other fearful noises, while flashes of lightning revealed monstrous apparitions to his sight. After three days and nights of this kind of experience, he was laid on a couch in a solitary cell; there was a sudden crash of waters, typifying the deluge, and the murder of Dionysus was enacted, his limbs being scattered on the waters. Then, amid lamentations, commenced the search of Rhea for the remains of Dionysus, and the apartments were filled with shrieks and groans, accompanied by the frantic dances of the Corybantes. Suddenly the body was found, the scene changed to one of joy, and the aspirant was released from his confinement. After that he descended into the infernal regions, where he saw the sufferings of the wicked and the rewards of the good, and afterwards became an epopt or seer - one who could look upon the world from above, see it as a whole, and therefore understand it. Among the followers of this Bacchic form of the Mysteries were the celebrated Dionysian Artificers, a secret society, bound by the most rigid pledges never to reveal their s … and p … w …, and employing emblems adopted from the building trade. These wandering bands of workmen built temples all over Syria and Asia Minor, just as the bands of Freemasons afterwards built churches in Europe. Bro. Ward writes of them:

They appear to have reached Asia Minor from the south-east, and, according to Strabo, could be traced through Syria and Phoenicia, via Persia and India. Apparently they reached Phoenicia about fifty years before the building of K.S.’s temple, and it is their presence which alone explains how that temple came to be built. Indeed, the Bible itself makes it abundantly clear that the temple was not built by Jews, who at that time were an agricultural race, quite incapable of undertaking the task of building such an elaborate edifice.

From the same source we learn that the chief architects and men came from Phoenicia, and Phoenician letters have been found on what are believed to be the foundations of the first temple … From Phoenicia they spread first into Asia Minor, and thence into Greece, from which country Greek colonists no doubt in the course of time carried members of the guild to Magna Grecia, which was the early name for South Italy.* (^An Outline History of Freemasonry, by Ward, p. 22.)

It is said that this cult of Dionysus survived up to 1908 in Thrace, in a slightly modified form at Viza, and may still exist.* (^R. M. Dawkins, Journal of Hellenic Studies, xxvi (1906), pp. 191-206.)

In the same land of Phoenicia, the mysteries of Adonis or Tammuz were celebrated at Byblos or Gebal, where lived the Gibelim or Stone-squarers, deriving their name from that of the town. The legend of these mysteries is an interesting combination of those of Egypt and Eleusis, the death and resurrection of Adonis being interwoven with a theme upon his exile and return for six months of the year, which reminds us of the fate of Persephone.

This cult appears in many forms, some of them savage and sanguinary, evidently derived from the dark and debased delusions of prehistoric and even cannibal tribes. Some hint of these may be seen in the account given on p. 000.

The mysteries of Attis and Cybele in Phrygia had many points in common with the last-named, the death and resurrection of Attis being the central myth. Other mystery-cults existed also, all teaching similar ideas. That of the Kabeiroi in Samothrace, which was held in great honour in the ancient world, is thought by some scholars to be the oldest of them all - a theory which is supported by the barbarous names of the deities involved. But even these are myths of death and resurrection, the god being in this case called Kasmillos.

It seems probable that when Virgil, in the sixth book of the Aeneid, depicted the descent of Aeneas into hell, he intended to give a representation of what happened in some of these Mysteries.

2      THE MITHRAIC MYSTERIES

ZARATHUSTRA AND MITHRAISM

THE Mysteries of Mithra were in many ways similar to those of Greece, but they always had certain characteristics which were especially their own, and the line of succession which they transmitted was distinct from that of the three degrees of Blue Masonry; some of the more important features of its ritual seem to have passed over into the 18°. There was a strong military flavour about them, and they demanded from their devotees a purity of life which was almost ascetic.

Just as the Mysteries of Egypt and Greece arose respectively from the incarnations of the World Teacher as Thoth and Orpheus, so did the Mithraic scheme arise from His incarnation as the first Zarathustra about 29,700 B.C. in Persia. It taught of Mithra, Captain of the hosts of the God of Light and Saviour of mankind.

MITHRAISM AMONG THE ROMANS

It is said that Mithraism was first transmitted to the Roman world during the first century B.C. by the Cilician pirates captured by Pompey; but, as we have already seen, it was before that time in the possession of the Essene communities in Palestine. For nearly two centuries it attained no great importance in Rome, and it was not until the end of the first century A.D. that it began to attract serious attention. Towards the close of the second century, the cult had spread rapidly through the army, the mercantile class and the slaves, all of which classes were largely composed of Asiatics. It throve especially at the military posts, and in the track of trade, where its monuments have been discovered in greatest abundance. Some twenty of the Mithraic temples still remain, and they show certain points of resemblance to our Masonic Lodges. The temple was rectangular, with a raised platform at the east end, often apsidal in form; continuous benches ran along its walls on the longer sides for the accommodation of the Brn., and the ceiling was made to symbolize the firmament.

Jerome (Epist. cvii) tells us that the system consisted of seven degrees: Corax, the Raven, so-called not only because the raven was the servant of the sun in Mithraic mythology, but because the raven can only imitate speech and not originate ideas for himself;* (^Cf. the Akoustikoi of the Pytagoreans, and the fact that the due-gard of the 1º shows that the E.A. must confine himself to what is taught in the V.S.L.) Cryphius,  the Occult, a degree in the taking of which the mystic was perhaps hidden from others in the sanctuary by a veil, the removal of which was a solemn ceremonial; Miles, the Soldier, signifying the holy warfare against evil in the service of the God; Leo, the Lion, symbolic of the element of fire, which played so great a part in the Persian faith; Perses, the Persian, clad in Asiatic costume, a reminiscence of the ancient origin of the religion; Heliodromus, the Courier of the Sun, with whom Mithra was identified; and Pater, the Father, a degree bringing the mystic among those who had the general direction of the cult for the rest of their lives.

It is not easy to trace exact correspondences between these seven stages and our own degrees, because of the difference between the systems. The Corax is fairly parallel with the E.A., and the Cryphius and Miles with the F.C., the latter being distinguished from the former by additional knowledge which may not inaptly be compared with that of the Mark degree. These three classes together were regarded to some extent as servitors; the next stage, Leo, was the first whose members were called “participants” and admitted to the Mithraic sacrament. We may consider the three stages of Leo, Perses and  Heliodromus as divisions of the M.M. degree; the first gave access to the full fellowship of the Mithraic brotherhood, the second passed him who received it through a most impressive ceremony in the course of which he was symbolically slain and raised to life in honour of Mithra, and the third put him in possession of additional knowledge equivalent to that which is supposed to be given to us in the Holy Royal Arch; for only when he had that knowledge of the name and qualities of the deity was he fitted to go forth as a messenger of the Sun to bear his strength and life through the world. The Pater corresponded to our I.M., who alone can confer the various degrees and pass on the succession to posterity.

THE MITHRAIC RITES

The Mithraic cult was essentially a religion of soldiers, a veritable brotherhood of arms. Women were never admitted to their rites of initiation, although it seems probable that in earlier times there were separate degrees for them. The power flowing through the rites gave especially courage and purity, and the demands upon the candidates in both these respects were exceedingly high. There was an intensity of brotherly feeling between the initiates of Mithra which is rarely realized in our Lodges to-day; they were pledged to fight for the right, and they stood shoulder to shoulder against all foes.

The Mithraic sacrament consisted of bread and wine and salt, and was consecrated at a solemn ceremony in the Mysteries, being linked to that aspect of the Deity which was represented by Mithra, and intensely charged with force along the characteristic lines of purity, courage and brotherhood, helping to bind the brethren together into a body corporate as soldiers of Light and Truth. This same Eucharist has been transmitted to us to-day through the Culdee line of tradition, in the ceremonial of the Rose-Croix of Heredom; but the forces flowing through it have been modified to some extent, so that instead of a Brotherhood of Arms we have now a Brotherhood of Love. The power of love takes the place of the military influence of courage, although the method of consecration in the higher worlds is the same. This is due to a blending with the Egyptian line of tradition.

The analogies between Mithraism and Christianity are very close; they are well summarized thus in the Encyclopedia Britannica:

The fraternal and democratic spirit of the first communities, and their humble origin; the identification of the object of adoration with light and the Sun; the legends of the shepherds with their gifts and adoration, the flood, and the ark; the representation in art of the fiery chariot, the drawing of water from the rock; the use of bell and candle, holy water and the communion; the sanctification of Sunday and of the 25th of December; the insistence on  moral conduct, the emphasis placed upon abstinence and self-control; the doctrine of heaven and hell, of primitive revelation, of the mediation of the Logos emanating from the divine, the atoning sacrifice, the constant warfare between good and evil and the final triumph of the former, the immortality of the soul, the last judgment, the resurrection of the flesh and the fiery destruction of the universe - these are some of the resemblances … At their root lay a common Eastern origin rather than any borrowing?* (^Ency. Brit. (11th Edn.), Art. Mithras.)

The Great Powers behind evolution appear at one time to have thought seriously of making Mithraism the religion of the fifth sub-race instead of the maimed Christianity which had rejected its own gnosis and put aside its Mysteries. But the ideal of Mithraic purity was so high that it would probably have been impossible for men to follow it during the Dark Ages; and another very serious objection to the system was that it absolutely excluded women. Mithraism was allowed therefore to sink into the background and finally to pass out of sight of the outer world. Nevertheless the ancient succession is still guarded and the rites are preserved in the custody of the H.O.A.T.F.; so Mithraism may yet have its part to play in the religious life of the future.

In addition to the Mysteries of Mithra, there was an Atlantean tradition of the Mysteries - that to which we have already referred as the Chaldaean line of succession. In the days of its splendour the Chaldaean rituals put the initiate into relation with the great Star-Angels who were adored in that mighty faith; and a relic of this tradition is still found in the hidden side of certain of the degrees of the rites of Memphis and of Mizraim. The Chaldaean method of seating the Principal Officers of a Lodge is still preserved in Continental Masonry, and has passed also into certain of the higher degrees.

THE ROMAN COLLEGIA

We may now return to the main line of Masonic descent, that of the three Craft degrees. We have already seen how the Jewish Mysteries handed down the essentials of our Masonic rites; it remains for us to trace their transmission to our modern Lodges. The next link in the chain is the Roman Collegia, in which the transition from speculative to operative Masonry took place.

We have seen that the science of architecture was always closely connected with the Mysteries, and that our Masonic Craft ritual when properly worked is designed to build a superphysical temple of the Ionic order of architecture, which was chosen because it is the vehicle of the special type of force which flows through Craft Masonry.* (^See The Hidden Life in Freemasonry, p. 120.)

Other forms are built by the higher degrees, belonging to different kinds of architecture, according to the influences which are to be radiated through them; so we see that we are in the presence of a science of spiritual building, of which material architecture is but the reflection in the dense matter of the physical plane. Each order of architecture expresses an idea and is the channel of certain types of influence associated with that idea, attracting the attention of certain kinds of Angels who work along the lines of that idea in the invisible worlds. Each sub-race has its own characteristic type of architecture as well as its own type of music, and these are often utilized by the Great Ones behind in order to impress upon the people certain characteristics which are necessary for their evolution.

The principles of this inner science of building were taught in the ancient Mysteries, and the temples of the different faiths were planned by the priests with full knowledge of the hidden side of what they were doing; it was for this reason that builders were always associated with temples and temple-worship, and the secrets of building were carefully guarded as part of the teaching of the Mysteries. Thus the confusion between speculative and operative, which was purposely effected at the breaking-up of the Roman Empire, presented no difficulties to the Powers behind, since those two aspects had always worked in close association, and it was merely a question of emphasizing the one, and of temporarily withdrawing the other into yet further silence and secrecy. No essential change was required.

THE WORK OF KING NUMA

Plutarch tells us that the Roman Collegia were originally founded by Numa, the second king of Rome, who lived during the seventh century B.C.* (^Plutarch’s Life of Numa, A. H. Clough, Vol. i, p. 152.) Numa is a half-legendary figure to our modern historians; but he was a very real personage, and the true founder of the Roman Mysteries as well as of the trade guilds. Plutarch says of his character:

He was endued with a soul rarely tempered by nature and disposed to virtue, which he had yet more subdued by discipline, a severe life, and the study of philosophy … He banished all luxury and softness from his own home, and, while citizens alike and strangers found in him an incorruptible judge and counsellor, in private he devoted himself not to amusement or lucre, but to the worship of the immortal Gods, and the rational contemplation of their divine power and nature.* (^Ibid., pp. 130, 131.)

Numa was “deeply versed, so far as anyone could be in that age, in all law, divine and human,* (^Livy., Bk. I, xviii (Loeb Ed.)) says Livy; while Dio Cassius tells us that he shaped the political and peaceable institutions of Rome, as Romulus had determined its military career.* (^Dio's Roman History, Loeb. Ed., p. 29.) In addition to all his external ability, he was far advanced on the Path of Holiness, and was a high Initiate of the White Lodge. His especial work was laying down, at the very beginning of the Roman State, the inner foundation of Rome’s future greatness; he moulded both her outer religion and her inner Mysteries, which in later days were to be the channel of that spiritual force which would make Rome mighty among the nations, one of the greatest empires that the world has ever known.

Numa sent messengers to Egypt, to Greece, to Chaldaea, to Palestine and other lands, to study all existing systems of the Mysteries, so that he might adopt in Rome those most suited to the development of his people. His high occult rank opened all doors; and like Pythagoras, an even greater Initiate, who came later, he was enabled to synthesize many lines of tradition into one comprehensive whole. The system which appears to have been adopted in Rome was that of the Mysteries of Dionysus or Bacchus, which, as we have already seen, closely corresponded to the Egyptian system; and here we have the first of the links with the Dionysian Artificers of whom Masonic tradition so persistently speaks.

Numa introduced the Egyptian line of succession, and thus the hierophants of his Mysteries were I.M.s. after the manner of the priests of Egypt and the Masons of to-day. This succession appears to have been handed down in secret among the Colleges of Architects until the time when Christianity began to dominate the Roman world at the beginning of the third century A.D. The fortunes of the Colleges or guilds which were thus formed were very varied; gradually they rose to great political power, were abolished by the senate about 80 B.C., and restored again twenty years later. The Emperors issued edicts against them from time to time, but those which could prove their antiquity or religious character were permitted to remain in existence. They were finally abolished in A.D. 378.

THE COLLEGES AND THE LEGIONS

Of these Colleges of Architects one was attached to every Roman Legion, building for it fortifications in time of war and in time of peace temples and houses. It was thus that the Roman Mysteries were brought to Northern Europe. Wherever the Romans settled, the Collegia worked their rites, and in process of time native soldiers were initiated into their ranks, until the system became deeply-rooted in each Roman colony. Closely connected with these rites were those of Mithra which, as we have seen, were also spread by the Roman armies, although the two systems were always kept separate and distinct.

The organization of the Colleges, as extant records show, corresponded in many ways with that of our modern Lodges. “Tres faciunt Collegium” – “Three make a College” was one of their principles; and the rule was so indispensable that it became a maxim of civil law. The College was ruled by a Magister or Master, and two Decuriones or Wardens; and among other officers were a treasurer, sub-treasurer, secretary and archivist.* (^R. F. Gould, History of Freemasonry, Vol. I, p. 42.) There was also a Sacerdos or Chaplain, who was in charge of the religious side of the work. The members of the College consisted of three grades corresponding closely to Apprentices, Fellows and Masters; and records point to the fact that  they possessed semi-religious rites which were kept rigidly secret, and also that they attached symbolic interpretations to their tools, such as the square and compasses, the plumb-rule and level. They took pagan gods as their patrons in much the same way as the guilds which succeeded them adopted Christian patron saints. The Four Crowned Martyrs, the patron saints of Masonry, were Christian members of a College who were tortured to death by the Emperor Diocletian for refusing to make a statue of Aesculapius.* (^J. S. M. Ward: Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods, pp. 144, 145.) They were later confused with the tradition of the Four Brothers of Horus.

Bro. J. S. M. Ward describes a building of the Collegia unearthed at Pompeii in 1878, which had been buried in A.D. 79, during the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It contains striking Masonic correspondences. There are two columns, and on the walls are interlaced triangles. Upon a pedestal in the centre was found an inlaid marble slab with a skull, level and plumb-rule and other Masonic designs in mosaic work. A fresco in another building close by shows a figure in the act of making the F.C.H.S.* (^J. S. M. Ward: Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods, pp. 115, 116.) The Roman Colleges of Architects were brought to Britain by the Roman army. One legion under Julius Caesar established a colony at Eboracum or York, later to be so prominent in Masonic legend and tradition; and another centre was at Verulam, afterwards known as S. Albans.

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE JEWISH FORM

The introduction of the Jewish form of the Masonic ceremonies was intentionally arranged by the Powers who stand behind Freemasonry about the time when Christianity was gaining ascendancy in the Roman Empire. It would have been almost impossible to continue the Mysteries of Bacchus or those of Mithra in their original form, while there was so much opposition between the Christian faith and the old Pagan religion. No such opposition was in Roman days felt towards the Jews, among whom the Christian faith arose and had its early nurture; and the Jewish form of the Mysteries was therefore adopted by the White Lodge as the best means of transmitting the ancient rites through the Dark Ages, when the Church rigorously persecuted all who were not in agreement with her doctrines. The chief agent in the work of transition was He who was then known as S. Alban, but whom to-day we revere as the Master the Comte de S. Germain, the Head of all true Freemasons throughout the world. I have given some account of Him and His Roman incarnation in The Hidden Life in Freemasonry.* (^Op. cit., pp. 12-16)

THE TRANSITION TO THE OPERATIVES

The Mysteries of Bacchus quite naturally and gradually gave place to the Jewish form of the same tradition as Christianity grew more and more powerful; for this was not incompatible with the Christian faith as the Greek and Egyptian traditions would have been; and the speculative secrets were more and more confused with operative terminology until the transition was complete. When the Roman Empire of the West was destroyed, political power came more and more into the hands of the Church, which grew very suspicious of secret societies, and suppressed them with great vigour. She did not, however, persecute the operative Masons, whom she regarded as a body of men wisely guarding the secrets of their trade, which she supposed to be concerned with the measurements of columns and arches, quantities for the mixing of mortar, and other such things.

The Masters of the White Lodge, therefore, intentionally confused the symbolical with the operative working and thus preserved Blue Masonry, but permitted the higher wisdom to sink for the time out of sight. Thus they provided for such of the egos born in Europe as could not develop under the cruder teaching which was mis-called Christianity.

This effort to preserve the Mysteries in the Dark Ages was successful because the speculative Masons adopted as much as they could of the operative Masons’ terminology, and entrusted them with some of the secrets. The latter then faithfully carried on the forms without comprehending more than half of what they meant.

Then those who held philosophical ideas of which the Church would not approve allied themselves with the operative masons, became members of the fraternity, and attended their meetings; they did not come into the guilds as operative masons, and therefore were not bound as apprentices, but were free masons accepted into the operative body, but not belonging to it by right of physical-plane work. The tradition of the Collegia passed into the Lodges of the guilds, as we shall see in the next chapter, and the ancient succession of I.M.s, which we in Britain trace through S. Alban, was handed down unbroken from century to century. In consequence of this persecution, and the partial restoration of Masonry in different forms in different countries, its outward history had been obscured and confused in the greatest possible degree. It is a matter that might no doubt be elucidated by long and painstaking research, but it would be a task involving far too great an expenditure of energy and time.

2      CRAFT MASONRY IN MEDIEVAL TIMES

EVOLUTIONARY METHODS

THE theory of human evolution ordinarily put before us is that of a slow upward progress of man from extremely primitive and almost animal conditions through the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, until he has arrived at his present level, which is by this hypothesis  the highest which he has yet attained. This view is only partially true; it is only on the one hand in a very broad and general sense covering a development lasting many millions of years, and on the other in a purely local sense affecting one or two sub-races, that it can be said to be true at all, for it leaves entirely out of account some of the most important factors in the case.

Let no one ever doubt that evolution is a fact - that God has a plan for man, and that that plan is one of eternal advancement and unfoldment, carrying him on to heights of glory and splendour of which at present we have no conception.

Yet we doubt not through the ages one eternal purpose runs.

And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.* (^Locksley Hall, by Lord Tennyson.)

But if we wish to understand anything of this wondrous scheme we must begin by trying to grasp its general principles. First, it is no mere haphazard growth; it is being definitely directed from behind by a body of perfected men which we call the Great White Brotherhood - a body which exists to carry out the will of the Logos of the solar system. It works through machinery so vast and complicated that from the physical plane we can never see more than a tiny corner of its operation, and so we constantly misconceive and underrate it.

Secondly, its method of working is cyclical. The soul of man grows by occupying a succession of bodies, each of which is born, grows slowly to maturity, lives its life, learns (or fails to learn) its lesson, and then dies. Just so humanity grows by incarnating in a succession of races, each of which passes through its stage of youth, adolescence, full manhood and decay. Often the period of decay seems sad, both with the man and with the race; often the student of history cannot but regret the passing of a once mighty and splendid civilization to make way for a savagery possibly more virile, but certainly in its youth coarser and cruder.

A flagrant example of that was the destruction of the gentle and beautiful civilization of Peru by the incredibly cruel and atrocious methods of the invading Spaniards; another very similar case was the utterly unjustifiable attack upon the civilization of Rome by the ferocious hordes of Goths and Vandals from the north. So coarse, so brutal were they that their very names have become a proverb, and we use them to-day to indicate the extremes of clumsiness and wanton destruction. Yet they also were an instrument in the hand of the divine power, and their crass ignorance contained within itself the seed of certain qualities which were in danger of dying out and being forgotten among the decaying races which they were destined to leaven and partially to replace.

THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MYSTERIES

Even before the destruction of the Roman Empire the withdrawal of the Mysteries as public institutions had taken place; and this fact was mainly due to the excessive intolerance displayed by the Christians. Their amazing theory that none but they could be “saved” from the hell which they themselves had invented naturally led them to try all means, even the most cruel and diabolical persecutions, to force people of other faiths to accept their particular shibboleth. As the Mysteries were the heart and stronghold of a more rational belief, they of course opposed them bitterly, quite forgetful that in the earlier days of their religion they had claimed to possess as much of the inner knowledge as any other system.

THE CHRISTIAN MYSTERIES

Even to-day it is quite commonly thought that Christianity had no mysteries, and some of its followers boast that in it nothing is hidden. That mistaken idea has been so sedulously impressed upon the world that it leads many people to feel a certain distaste for the wiser faiths which met all needs, and to think of them as unnecessarily hiding part of the truth or grudging it to the world. In the old days there was no such thought as this; it was recognized that only those who came up to a certain standard of life were fit to receive the higher instruction, and those who wished for it set to work to qualify themselves for it. Knowledge is power, and people must prove their fitness before they will be entrusted with power; for the object of the whole scheme is human evolution, and the interests of evolution would not be served by promiscuous publication of occult truth.

Those who maintain the above-mentioned opinion about Christianity are unacquainted with the history of the Church. Though many of the early Christian writers are bitterly hostile to the Mysteries, they indignantly deny the suggestion that in their Church they have nothing worthy of that name, and claim that their Mysteries are in every way as good and deep and far-reaching as those of their ‘pagan’ opponents. S. Clement says: “He who has been purified in baptism and then initiated into the little Mysteries (has acquired, that is to say, the habits of self-control and reflection), becomes ripe for the greater Mysteries, for Epopteia or Gnosis, the scientific knowledge of God.”* (^Quoted in Some Glimpses of Occultism, Ch. ii.) The same writer also said: “It is not lawful to reveal to profane persons the Mysteries of the Logos.”

Origen, the most brilliant and learned of all the ecclesiastical Fathers, also asserts the existence of the secret teaching of the Church, and speaks plainly of the difference between the ignorant faith of the undeveloped multitude, and the higher and reasonable faith which is founded upon definite knowledge. He draws a distinction between “the popular irrational faith” which leads to what he calls “somatic Christianity” (the merely physical form of the religion) and the “spiritual Christianity” offered by the Gnosis or wisdom. He makes it perfectly clear that by “somatic Christianity” he means that faith which is based on the gospel history. He says of it: “What better method could be devised to assist the masses?” In Dean Inge’s Christian Mysticism he is quoted as teaching that:

The Gnostic or sage no longer needs the crucified Christ. The eternal or spiritual gospel which is his possession shows clearly all things concerning the Son of God Himself both the Mysteries shown by his words and the things of which his acts were the symbols … Origen regards the life, death and resurrection of Christ as only one manifestation of a universal law, which was really enacted not in this fleeting world of shadows, but in the eternal counsels of the Most High. He considers that those who are thoroughly convinced of the universal truths revealed by the incarnation and the atonement need trouble themselves no more about their particular manifestations in time.* (^Op. cit., p. 89.)

Here we see distinct and repeated references to the hidden teaching, greater far than anything known to the Church of the present day, and carrying those who study it to a much higher level than is ever now attained by the disciples of orthodoxy. What has become of this magnificent heritage of Christianity? It is true that everything the Church knows is now given out, but that is only because she has forgotten the mysteries which she used to keep hidden. This is one of the principal reasons why she has lost control of her more intellectual sons, and has therefore failed in her duty to educate and instruct the people in the most important things of life, and has left our age the most unpractical one ever known.

We have come into this world to live our lives, not to make money, and on the way in which we live depends the condition of our future births. One would think, therefore, that people would be taught all about these things in school. It is certain that every one must die, but nobody tells us anything that is worth knowing about that important matter. On the contrary, exoteric Christianity in the days of its power positively forbade those who knew to say anything on the subject, and enforced with the most terrible weapons its incredibly foolish commandment: “Thou shalt not think.”

Happily all this wonderful wisdom is not lost, for much of it is preserved to us in the teachings of Freemasonry. There were many thousands of people at the time when Christianity began to dominate the world who still clung to the ancient tradition, who preferred to state their views in the older forms. As Christianity grew narrower and more aggressive, and less tolerant of fact, those who knew something of the truth, and wished to preserve its enshrinement in those older forms, had more and more to keep their meetings secret; for the Church was exceedingly intolerant towards anyone who dared to differ from her, even in minor matters.

THE REPRESSION OF THE MYSTERIES

In A.D. 399 the Emperor Theodosius issued his celebrated edict, which was a heavy blow to the outer manifestation of the ancient pagan faith:

Whatever privileges were conceded by the ancient laws to the priests, ministers, prefects, hierophants of sacred things, or by whatsoever name they may be designated, are to be abolished henceforth, and let them not think that they are protected by a granted privilege when their religious confession is known to have been condemned by the law.

By A.D. 423 the penalties against those who clung to the old beliefs had become severe, for in a later edict of the same Emperor we find:

Although the pagans that remain ought to be subjected to capital punishment if at any time they are detected in the abominable sacrifices of demons, let exile and confiscation of goods be their punishment.* (^Codex Theodosianus XVI, 10, 14, 23, quoted in A Source Book for Ancient Church History. Ayer, p. 371.)

Wherever possible the temples of the gods were destroyed, the ancient libraries were burnt, the statues and other relics were broken in pieces by the brutal hands of the savage Christians - and what destruction remained to be accomplished in the Western Empire was completed by the no less barbarian invaders. So perished the outer worship of the gods of Greece and Rome; the Mysteries were withdrawn into inviolable secrecy, which remained unbroken until after the Reformation, when the Church had lost her power to burn and torture all who did not at least pretend to be in agreement with her doctrines.

THE CROSSING OF TRADITIONS

This retirement took place in several countries simultaneously, so several traditions arose which, like the mystery-systems from which they were derived, differed considerably in their details, though they were always based upon a common plan. These traditions have crossed  and recrossed one another constantly throughout the centuries, have influenced each other in all sorts of secret ways, have been carried from country to country by many messengers; so that the Masonry which emerged in the eighteenth century bears the signature of many lines of descent, of many interacting schools of mystical philosophy.

Behind all these different movements, utterly unknown except by the few disciples charged with the work of keeping alight the sacred fire during the Dark Ages, stood the White Lodge itself, encouraging all that was good in them, guiding and inspiring all who were willing to open themselves to such influence.

By efflux of time the true philosophy has gradually faded out of them again and again, and from time to time the adepts have taken advantage of some favourable opportunity to restore a little of it sometimes by founding a new rite or school, sometimes by instigating the establishment of additional degrees in an existing rite. We see, therefore, a number of parallel and equally valid streams of tradition running down in secret throughout the Middle Ages, and emerging here and there in movements which are to some extent known in the outer world. The real continuum of Masonry may thus be compared to the roots of a plant creeping along under the ground, and giving forth apparently separate plants at intervals. There are, however, more or less broken lines of outward descent that may be traced up to a certain point on the physical plane; it is with these that we shall especially concern ourselves in the following chapters.

THE TWO LINES OF DESCENT

We have already indicated that the only portion of the Masonic tradition which was anciently divided into definite degrees is that which we now call Craft or symbolic Masonry - the direct descendant of the Lesser and the Greater Mysteries of Egypt and Judaea, and closely akin to the Mysteries of Greece. Greater sacramental powers were conferred and deeper spiritual instruction was given to the few who were endeavouring to prepare themselves for the true Mysteries of the White Lodge; but these cannot be called degrees after the manner of Craft Masonry, for even in ancient Egypt they were not organized as such. Both these lines of sucession passed down through the Middle Ages; the Craft degrees were deliberately confused with operative building, and were thus transmitted, although in secrecy, in the outer  world, but the higher instruction still belonged only to the few, and was handed down in far deeper secrecy still, being introduced from time to time into the heart of various mystical schools, which were much more exclusive in their choice of members than the operative  builders.

With the Craft degrees were associated the kernel of those ceremonies which we now attach to the Honourable Degree of Mark Master Mason, connected, as always, with the 2°, and the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Jerusalem, worked in conjunction with the 3°. Our present rituals for these are not therefore necessarily ancient, for all have been subjected to much modern recasting and editing. A body of legend and tradition explanatory of the ceremonial appears also to have been handed down; and the relics of this have in comparatively recent times been manufactured into separate ceremonial degrees - such, for example, as certain of the earlier stages of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and their kindred among the side or additional degrees worked in England and America.

THE CULDEES

A noteworthy line of tradition, connected with Craft Masonry to some extent, but even more with the Royal Order of Scotland and the 18°, is found among the Culdees of Ireland, Scotland and York. Few trustworthy sources of information exist concerning them, though they have been the centre of many beautiful dreams; but they are thought by scholars to have been either an ancient monastic order with settlements in Ireland and Scotland,* (^Enc. Brit., Art. Culdees (Eleventh Ed.)) or in a wider sense to have represented the monks and clerics of the Celtic Church without limitation, as well as those understood to be their successors in later times.* (^Hist. Freemasonry, R. F. Gould, Vol. I, p. 47.)

We hear of them in Ireland from the ninth to the seventeenth centuries; from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries in Scotland, where they had several influential monastic communities, including one upon the holy island of Iona, which had been one of the greatest spiritual centres of Celtic Christianity long before the word Culdee is mentioned in the historical records concerning it. In Wales in the twelfth century there was a strict community of Culdees living in the island of Bardsey, the holy island of Wales; while in England we find them as officiating clergy in the Cathedral Church of S. Peter at York during the reign of King Athelstan, who was so closely linked with English Masonic tradition.* (^Hist. Freemasonry, R. F. Gould, Vol. I, p. 50 ff.) It is said that after requesting the prayers of the Culdees for victory over the Scots, when he was successful he granted them a perpetual endowment of corn, to enable them to continue their works of charity.

Their name has been derived from the Celtic Cele-De, meaning Companion or Servant of God, and from the Latin Colidei, worshippers of God; others have thought that it came from the Celtic cuill dich, meaning men of seclusion; but the etymology of the word is not certainly known. Godfrey Higgins claimed that the word Culdee was the same as Chaldee, and ascribed to them an Oriental origin, although he adduces no authentic evidence for his views.* (^Quoted by Bro. A. E. Waite: A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry, Art. Culdees.)

CELTIC CHRISTIANITY IN BRITAIN

Students of English Church History know that Christianity was introduced into Great Britain long before the missions of S. Patrick and S. Augustine; and there has been a persistent feeling that this Christianity was not that of Rome, but had affinities rather with the Eastern  rites.* (^Neander, General History of the Christian Religion and Church, Vol. i. p. 117. Quoted Gould, loc. cit.) Many traditions, none of them substantiated by authentic records,  bear witness to this belief, and point the way to a truth in the background. There is the beautiful legend of Joseph of Arimathaea  and the Holy Thorn of Glastonbury; there is the story told by Theodoret and Fortunatus that S. Paul visited Britain, which appears to receive  some confirmation from S. Clement of Rome; while Eusebius, the great ecclesiastical historian, mentions that some of the twelve apostles visited the British Isles.* (^Foundation Stones. Austin Clare, p. 16.) Indeed it was not until the twelfth century that Celtic Christianity was finally brought into line with the usages of Roman Catholicism.* (^Enc. Brit., loc. cit.)

The holy island of Iona, once the heart of the old Celtic Church, lies off the west coast of Scotland among the Inner Hebrides. It was called Hy or Icolmkill (the island of Columba of the Church), and by the Highlanders Innis nan Druidhneah (the isle of the Druids), implying that before the coming of S. Columba in A.D. 563 it had been a hallowed centre of the ancient worship of the Celts.* (^Enc. Brit., Art. Iona.) The monks of Iona spread their learning over Sootland and Northern England, and the early Celtic Bishops owned the abbot of Iona as their spiritual head. In 717 the monks of Iona were expelled from Scotland by the Pictish King Nechtan; but their place was largely filled by the Culdees of Ireland,* (^Enc. Brit., Art. Culdees.) who appear to have been followers of the same tradition. No mention is made of the Culdees in Scotland after A.D. 1382.* (^Gould, loc. cit.)

We find that the early British Church, of which the Culdees were the later survivors, possessed a beautiful and mystical form of Christianity derived from Eastern sources and closely connected with the traditions of the Essenes, who were the immediate followers of Our Lord. It had the apostolic succession of the Christian Church, but its teachings were less defined and rigid, more mystical and poetic than the Roman scholasticism which in later days so completely absorbed it. In addition to the Christian sacraments, certain secret rites were  brought to Britain by the original missionaries, rites belonging to the Mithraic line of succession, which, as we have already seen, were practised among the Essenes; and there may also in all likelihood have existed among them a succession of Jewish Masonry unconnected with the Roman Collegia.

THE DRUIDIC MYSTERIES

These various lines of tradition were assimilated to some extent with the indigenous Mysteries of the Druids, which, however, had lost much of the splendour of former times; and even the outer Christian rites became touched with that peculiar beauty which is the heritage of the Celt. We find confirmation of the ancient legend that the splendid Celtic race called the Tuatha De Danaan, which flourished in ancient Ireland, came originally from Greece through Scandinavia; and the same is true of other offshoots of the Celtic stock which settled in Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. They all formed a branch of that Fourth Sub-race from which the later Greeks and Romans were also descended; and the origin of the Mysteries of the Druids may be traced to the great World Teacher, in His incarnation as Orpheus, the singer of Hellas, though they were also influenced somewhat by the still older Mysteries of Ireland which date from Atlantean times. The lyre of Apollo became the harp of Angus; and the old worship of God as the divine beauty manifesting through music thus passed down into Britain.

The Druidical Mysteries had a certain influence on the imported Roman or Norman rites. They are compared by Strabo and Artemidorus to the rites of Samothrace, and by Dionysius to those of Bacchus, while Mnaseas refers to their Kabiric correspondences. We learn from Diogenes Laertius and from Caesar that the Druidic method of instruction was by symbols, enigmas and allegories, and that they taught orally, deeming it unlawful to commit their knowledge to writing. It is said that their ceremonies of initiation required much physical purification and mental preparation. In the first degree the aspirant’s symbolical death was represented, and in the third his regeneration from the womb of the giant goddess Ceridwin and the committal of the newly-born to the waves in a small boat, symbolical of the ark. Their doctrines were similar to those of Pythagoras - including reincarnation and the existence of one Supreme Being. Apart from a few stray references in classical authors, we know of them today chiefly through the Bardic songs attributed to the Welsh poet Taliesin, of the sixth century A.D., who claimed Druidic initiation. Culdees of York blended Christian mysticism with these pre-Christian rites, and so linked them with modern Masonry.

There have been many other mysteries, such as those of Ireland, closely connected with the Druids, and of Scandinavia, wherein the death and resurrection of Balder was the chief theme, and no doubt all these were connected with the source of our present Masonry, being branches of the same tree, even though external traces of their relationship in the past have disappeared.

THE HOLY GRAIL

As part of this indirect heritage from the Greek Mysteries came the well-known symbol of the Krater or Cup, which in the intermingling with early British Christianity was identified with the Sangreal, the Chalice used by our Lord at the Last Supper for the founding of the Holy Eucharist. King Arthur, who has often been supposed to be an imaginary hero, was a very real and most lovable and sagacious ruler, of whom England may well be proud; his Round Table also is fact and not fiction, and among its Knights there was a rite of the Christian Mysteries centring round the beautiful story of the quest for the Holy Grail. Some there were who took the legend literally and undertook endless physical-plane pilgrimages in search of an earthly cup; others knew that the mystical meaning of the finding of the Holy Grail is the union between the higher and the lower self, which is one of the qualifications for initiation into the true Mysteries of the White Lodge; for the Chalice symbolically represents the causal body into which the “blood” of the Mystery is poured. “I am the cup, His love the wine.” The Mysteries of the Holy Grail were simultaneously celebrated in various centres, both in Great Britain and on the Continent, where they doubtless became mingled with other lines of tradition; and in them we find clear traces of one of those secret schools in which the flame of the hidden wisdom burnt bright during the early Middle Ages. The tradition of the Grail and its spiritual Knighthood passed into literature through the hands of Chretien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach and other writers, whence on the one hand we derive the Morte d’Arthur of Sir Thomas Malory, from which Tennyson drew the materials for his Idylls of the King, and on the other the glorious music of Parsifal, in which Wagner reconstructed so magnificently the German tradition of the Grail Brotherhood.

HEREDOM

In Scotland these secret Mysteries of the East and West were handed down from generation to generation in various centres, one of the chief of these being the sacred island of Iona. Among the initiates of the Culdee rites Iona was called Heredom. Heredom is said in Masonic tradition to be a mystical mountain, and as such it is indeed the mount of Initiation beyond the veils of space and time; but it was also the secret name of the physical centre of the Mysteries - and this centre was Iona. Another such secret centre in mediaeval days was the Abbey of Kilwinning; and thus, the rites which derive in part from Culdee sources have always styled themselves as of Kilwinning and of Heredom.

The Saxon invasion of Britain drove the Celtic inhabitants of the plains to the mountains of the west and north; and thus there was a further mingling of the Jewish Mysteries of the Collegia with the Culdee rites. The Culdees of York were among the guardians of the Masonic tradition in the tenth century, and the Old Charges tell us that an assembly of Masons was held at York during the reign of King Athelstan, when a reorganization of the Craft took place. For many centuries York was a powerful centre of Masonry; and we have a curious piece of testimony given in 1835, by Godfrey Higgins, who claimed to be in possession of a Masonic document by which he could prove that “no very long time ago” the Culdees or Chaldaeans of York were Freemasons, that they constituted the Grand Lodge of England, and that they held their meetings in the crypt under the great cathedral of that city.* (^Quoted in Waite’s New Encyclopaedia, Art. Culdees.) As we shall presently see, it was at York that certain important Masonic degrees emerged in the eighteenth century.

The monks of the Celtic Church were largely responsible for the introduction of Christianity into Germany. “Wherever they came they raised Churches and dwellings for their priests, cleared the forests, tilled the virgin soil, and instructed the heathen in the first principles of civilization.* (^Gould. Hist. Freem., Vol. I, p. 107.) Some German authorities have held that the monks directing these operations owed much of their success to the remnants of the Roman Colleges of Gaul and Britain, and ultimately laid the foundations of the craft guild system in Germany. Gould rejects this view on the ground that at the time of the Celtic influence there were no craft guilds in Germany;* (^Gould. Hist. Freem., Vol. I, p. 109.) but nevertheless some of the secret rites and traditions of the Celtic monks passed into the German monasteries and formed one of the lines of descent of those stonemasons who built the great German cathedrals in the Middle Ages.

In Scotland the Celtic Mystery-tradition passed down independently of the later operative Lodges, for there is no trace whatsoever of any high degrees in the extant Minutes of Mother Kilwinning, No. 0 upon the roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, which date from 1642.* (^History of the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary’s Chapel, No. I) D. Murray Lyon, pp. 340, 434.) There is truth in the legend of the coming of certain of the French Knights Templars to Scotland after their proscription in 1307, and there was an intermingling of their doctrines also with the Scottish rites. One line of descent crossed from Scotland to France, where it was blended in the eighteenth century with the Egyptian tradition to form the rite of Heredom or of Perfection under the Council of the Emperors of the East and West, as will be further explained in Chapter XI. Another line was handed down in Scotland and England, becoming blended with Jewish Tradition, and Emerged in the Degrees of HRDM-RSYCS in what we now call the Royal Order of Scotland. The curious rhymed ritual of the Royal Order bears internal evidences of age, and although its Christianity has been ruthlessly edited in protestant interests there are yet traces of the old mystical ideas of the Celtic Church.

2      OPERATIVE MASONRY IN THE MIDDLE AGES

THE TEMPORARY CUSTODIANS

IN a complete study of mediaeval operative Masonry it would be necessary to include a treatise upon the various schools of mediaeval architecture and the tendencies, national and economic, which influenced their creation and development. In this book we are concerned with the operative builders only in so far as they were the temporary custodians of the speculative science of the Mysteries; but the study of architecture is of considerable value to the Mason; for it is the physical-plane reflection of mighty ideas in the inner worlds, and by the study of architecture certain of the laws of spiritual building may by analogy be reached and understood.

As Masons, our speculative ancestry is noble and magnificent, for we are in that respect the lineal descendants of the kings and prophets and priests of old who have been the bearers of the Hidden Light to men through countless generations; but of our operative forefathers who so faithfully guarded the tradition in the days of darkness we may also be proud, for their art at its zenith was unsurpassed in richness and splendour by the achievements of any other age in Europe; the great cathedrals and monasteries which they built to the glory of God and in the service of His Church are touched with the finger of divine inspiration, so that the cold marble is transfigured into almost unbelievable grace and delicacy; they are veritable dreams of beauty materialized into stone. The operative Masons, too, have handed down to us many of their customs and usages; and it is well that we should understand these in addition to what we have derived from other sources.

When Europe was overrun by the Germanic tribes and the Empire of the West was destroyed, the Roman Collegia for the most part disappeared with the other fruits of civilization. The Mysteries enshrined in them survived in a more or less repressed form in Italy, France and England, although they were kept extremely secret for fear of the barbarian invaders. It was from these survivals that the Lodges of the guild Masons of the Middle Ages were derived.

DECLINE OF THE COLLEGIA

Mackey shows how the Collegia declined after the fall of Rome, and how new guilds were started and old ones revived under the patronage of the Christian clergy, and asserts that after the tenth century the whole of Europe was perambulated by bands of wanderers called Travelling Freemasons, who erected churches and monasteries in the Gothic style. Authorities differ seriously in opinion as to whether the fraternities who built the great cathedrals were joined together by any central organization. There is much in the similarity of style of building in the different countries, and in the Masonic signs upon the buildings, to indicate their connection, but the central organization must have allowed its branches great latitude, since the differences in style are also great. The cathedrals that the Travelling Freemasons built with such great skill and artistic inspiration were laid out upon a symbolic plan, usually based upon the cross and the vesica piscis, and there is some evidence that they moralized upon their tools. Undoubtedly these were men of the loftiest intellect and spirituality, and we modern speculative Masons have no reason to be ashamed of our associations with such operative craftsmen.

THE COMACINI

The first signs of a revival in the art of building, the first stirrings of that creative spirit which was to blossom in later years in the full glory of the Gothic, are to be found in Lombardy, where originated the style called Romanesque, which eventually spread all over Europe.  According to tradition, the College of Architects from Rome removed during the last days of the Empire to the safe refuge offered by the little republic of Comum, once the home of Pliny, and made its retreat upon the lovely island still known as Isola Comacina in Lake Como in Northern Italy.* (^The Cathedral Builders, Leader Scott; pp. 11, 140.) In A.D. 568 the surrounding country fell into the hands of the Lombards or Longobards, so-called from their long beards and uncouth appearance, whose original home had been in the lower basin of the Elbe; and although at first they were detested by the Italians, with surprising rapidity they developed enthusiasm for the arts and refinement of the land they had conquered.* (^History of Art, H. B. Cotterill, Vol. I, p. 232.)

The first mention in contemporary records of the celebrated Comacine Masters, who were descended from that Roman College, occurs in the code of the Lombard King Rothares (643), in which they figure as Master Masons with power to make contracts for building works and to employ workmen and labourers.* (^The Cathedral Builders, p. 5.) They are mentioned also in the Memoratorio of King Luitprand in 713,* (^Ibid., p. 24.) when they received the privileges of freemen in the Lombard State. To their creative genius Romanesque architecture is due; and in all probability they adapted the traditional Roman methods to the requirements of their Lombard masters. It is clear from the Edict that they were highly-skilled architects. From a letter from Theodoric the Great to an architect whom he had appointed, we learn that the profession was highly developed, and an architect had to be able to construct a building from foundation to roof, and also decorate it with sculpture and painting, mosaic and bronzework. This inclusiveness prevailed in all the mediaeval schools up to 1335, when the Siennese painters seceded; and subsequently other branches also separated themselves into distinct guilds.

The first dawn of the new style (c. 600) was followed by a long period of obscuration, not unlike that Dark Age which in the evolution of Greek art followed the Dorian conquest. Then, with a strange suddenness, sprang forth (c. 1000) in wonderful perfection the new style, and rapidly extended itself over much of western and northern Christendom - the rapidity of this extension being easily explainable by the fact that master-builders and workmen were often summoned to great distances from well-known centres of architecture. In the same way as Venice and Ravenna sent to Constantinople for Byzantine builders, Charles the Great and many other princes, as well as cities, procured  from Italy skilful Romanesque architects, such as the Comacine Masters, and the characteristics of this Lombard Romanesque are found not only in Germany and France but even in England.* (^History of Art, Vol. I, p. 230.)

Italian chroniclers relate that architects and builders were sent by Pope Gregory the Great to England with S. Augustine, and we learn from the Venerable Bede that S. Benedict Biscop set out for Gaul to search for masons to build the monastic church at Monk Wearmouth “according to the Roman style he had always loved”.* (^The Cathedral Builders, pp. 143, 154.) S. Boniface visited Italy before undertaking his great mission to Germany in A.D. 715; Pope Gregory II gave him instructions and credentials, and sent with him a large following of monks versed in the art of building, and of lay brethren who were also architects to assist him.* (^Ibid., p. 133.) Leader Scott contends that these builders were Comacine Masters, and bases her arguments upon the evidence of building methods and the similarity of the styles employed. In like manner she traces the Comacini into France and Normandy, Southern Italy and Sicily, and even to Ireland in fact wherever the Romanesque style of building has penetrated.

THE COMACINE LODGES

The Comacine Guild not only inherited the building traditions of the Collegia, but also their secret Mysteries; and it was largely owing to the impulse given by them that a general revival of the existing Lodges of Europe took place. A very considerable interchange of influence occurs at this time; new Lodges were founded and old Lodges were restored, for, although the primary inspiration came from Italy, the builders in the different countries soon learnt to modify the new style in accordance with national requirements and taste. Many of the higher brethren, the Magistri of the Guild, were men of wide culture and refinement, who knew much of the inner meaning of the rites and ceremonies handed down amongst them; and it may well be that some among them possessed the knowledge now belonging to the higher degrees, for high degree signs are occasionally found upon their work. The majority of the craftsmen, however, probably knew little more than that there was a symbolical meaning to their ceremonies and tools, and tried to order their lives accordingly.

As Bro. J. S. M. Ward has pointed out very clearly, the Comacini show marked analogies with our modern Masonic system. They were organized into Masters and Disciples under the rule of a Gastaldo or Grand Master. Their working-places were called Lodges. They had Masters and Wardens, signs, tokens, grips, pass-words and oaths of secrecy and fidelity. The Four Crowned Martyrs were their Patron Saints; they wore white aprons and gloves, and among the symbols associated with them we find the Lion of Judah, King Solomon’s knot, the square and compasses, the level and plumb-rule, and the rose and compasses.

On a pulpit at Ravello, in one of their buildings of the thirteenth century, Jonah is seen coming out of the whale’s mouth, making the  F.C.H.S.* (^Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods, J. S. M. Ward, Ch. xviii, passim.) At Coire Cathedral in Switzerland, which is Romanesque in style and contains abundant evidence of Comacine work, several figures on the capitals of the pillars in the choir and sanctuary are depicted making Masonic s … s, notably the F.C.H.S., the G. and R. S., and several s … s now associated with the Rose-Croix, Knights Templars, and other high degrees in Freemasonry.* (^An Outline History of Freemasonry, J. S. M. Ward, p. 34.) In the town-hall at Basle there is a fresco by Hans Dyg, painted in 1519, in which we may see the same s … s, and also one of the Mark degree. King Solomon’s knot is the traditional name among the Italians of to-day for the elaborate interlaced stonework executed by the Comacine Masters up to the eleventh century. It consists always of a single strand woven and interwoven in the most complex and beautiful designs. Leader Scott calls it “that intricate and endless variety of the single unbroken line of unity - emblem of the manifold ways of the power of the one God who has neither beginning nor end”.* (^The Cathedral Builders, p. 72.)

OTHER SURVIVALS OF THE COLLEGIA

Before passing on to the rise of Gothic architecture, which marks the climax of operative achievement in the Middle Ages, it will be well if we indicate certain other survivals of the Collegia and their Mysteries; for although the great impulse to restore the art of building came through the Comacine Masters, other Lodges had existed in Europe from Roman days which, under the influence of Italian inspiration, regained their power and vitality. In France especially it is clear that the organization of the Collegia was never fully destroyed and that the craft-guilds (Corps d’Etat) of the Middle Ages were derived from them in unbroken continuity.

The true origin of the corporation is found in the social life of the Romans, and amongst the vanquished Gauls, who always formed the principal population in the cities, and faithfully preserved under their new masters the remembrance and traces of their ancient organization.* (^Levasseur, Histoire des Classes Ouvrieres en France, Vol. i, p. 104, quoted Gould i, p. 182.)

Roman civil architecture, industry, art - in one word, the whole Roman tradition - was perpetuated in France till the tenth century. Even the German conquerors, while preserving their own national laws, customs, and usages, accepted the Gallic industry much as they found it.* (^Monteil, Histoire de l’Industrie Francaise, Preface by C. Louandre, p. 76, quoted ibid., p. 183.)

Not only was the trade organization preserved without break; the inner Mysteries of the Colleges of Architects were transmitted to the mediaeval building guilds of France, though they were no doubt strongly influenced by the Italian Masters who practised the same Mysteries and the same glorious Craft.

THE COMPAGNONNAGE

An interesting survival of the mediaeval craft-guilds of France is seen in an association of French journeymen for mutual support and assistance during their travels. Practically nothing was known about the practices of the Compagnonnage before the nineteenth century, although a partial revelation of one of the sections composing it (Enfants de Maitre Jacques) had been extracted by the Doctors of the Sorbonne in 1651, who not unnaturally stigmatized their proceedings as impiety and sacrilege. In 1841 the Livre du Compagnonnage was published by Agricol Perdiguier, a French workman of some culture, who undertook the task of revealing as much of the history and traditions of the Compagnonnage as his oath would permit, in order to put an end to the strife which ceaselessly occurred between its different sections.

The Compagnonnage consisted of three organizations perpetually at war with one another, each of which had an interesting traditional history and claimed a traditional chief. The oldest division was that of the Sons of Solomon, originally consisting of stonemasons only,  although joiners and locksmiths were admitted later; the second was that of the Sons of Maitre Jacques, who likewise admitted members of these three trades and later of many others, notably saddlers, shoemakers, tailors, cutlers, and hatters; while the third section  followed Maitre Soubise, and was originally composed only of carpenters, although at a later date plasterers and tilers were also admitted. It is generally conceded that the Sons of Solomon were the oldest of all; and another remarkable fact is that the masons (to be carefully distinguished from the Stonemasons) were never admitted at all. Houses of call belonging to these three associations existed in the more important towns of France; and travelling journeymen had the right to lodging and assistance in finding work in the houses belonging to their fraternity.

The three sections of the Compagnonnage preserved legends concerning King Solomon and his temple. Little is known of the form of the legend current among the Sons of Solomon, but there are curious indications that the story of the death of Hiram (which is not contained in the Bible) was known to them. Perdiguier tells us little, but he gives certain hints:

An ancient fable has obtained currency amongst them (the Sons of Solomon) relating, according to some, to Hiram, according to others, to Adonhiram; wherein are represented crimes and punishments. Again he tells us “that the joiners of Maitre Jacques wear white gloves, because, as they say, they did not steep their hands in the blood of Hiram”.

Furthermore with regard to the use of the word chien bestowed upon all the Compagnons du Devoir, he says:

It is believed by some to be derived from the fact that it was a dog which discovered the place where the body of Hiram, architect of the Temple, lay under the rubbish, after which all the companions who separated from the murderers of Hiram were called chiens or dogs.

Some have thought, and among them Perdiguier himself, that these are indications of a legend which may have been borrowed from the Freemasons; but they clearly point to an independent line of tradition handed down among the stonemasons of France. Maitre Jacques and Maitre Soubise have also their traditional histories, likewise going back to the days of Solomon’s Temple; and in that of the former an elaborate account of the death of Maitre Jacques is given, which may likewise be an echo of the death of another and greater Master - for it is clearly intended to be symbolical. There is also a suggestion that it was taken to refer to the death of Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templars. Much yet remains to be discovered about the Compagnonnage, for no full investigation into its records has yet taken place; and it may well be that future research will show clearly that the speculative Masons of England and the operative journeymen of France derive their traditions from a common ancestry in the ancient Mysteries. This at least was the opinion of R. F. Gould, the greatest of our Masonic historians.* (^See Gould. Hist. Freem., Vol. I, ch. iv and v, for a complete account of what is known of the French Craft Guilds and the Compagnonnage.)

THE STONEMASONS OF GERMANY

Another line of survival of the ancient tradition is found among the Stonemasons of Germany. We have already traced the influence of two streams of tradition into Germany, one emanating from Britain through the Celtic monks, and another coming from Italy through S. Boniface. The craft guilds of Germany developed independently of monastic influence, but according to Gould it is probable that in the twelfth century the skilled masons of the monasteries amalgamated with the craft builders in the towns, and together formed the society afterwards known throughout Germany as the Steinmetzen.* (^Concise History of Freemasonry, R. F. Gould, p. 17.)

We know from the Torgau Ordinances of 1462 that the Stonemasons venerated the Four Crowned Martyrs as their patron saints, and the Strasburg Constitutions of 1459 contain a devout invocation of the names of the “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; of our gracious Mother Mary; and of her blessed servants, the Holy Four Crowned Martyrs of everlasting memory”.* (^Gould, Concise History, p. 19.) From the Brother-Book of 1563 we learn that they had a greeting and a grip which might not be described in writing;* (^Gould, Hist. of Freem., Vol. i, p. 128.) and a curious piece of testimony came to light at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when a certain architect, who had joined a survival of the Stonemasons and was subsequently admitted into Masonry, recognized the E.A. grip as identical with that of the  Steinmetzen of Strasburg.* (^Ibid., p. 146.) A ceremony of admission was in use among them; but what it was is not known.* (^Concise History, Gould, p. 22.)

At Daberan in Mecklenburg there is a carving of the Last Supper, wherein the apostles are depicted in well-known Masonic attitudes,* (^An Outline History of Freemasonry, J. S. M. Ward, p. 35.) while according to the Bulletin of the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, U.S.A.) the legend of Hiram Abiff is carved in stone at Strasburg.* (^Op, cit., vii, 200.) In the cathedral at Wurzburg two pillars, inscribed Jachin and Boaz, originally stood at the porchway or entrance, but they have now been moved within the building. Stieglitz in his Early German Architecture says that they were intended to bear a symbolic reference to the fraternity.* (^Gould, Concise Hist., p. 24.) A bas-relief in a convent near Schaffhausen depicts a figure making one of the s … s of an I.M.* (^An Outline History of Freemasonry, J. S. M. Ward, p. 11.) In the year 1459 the Stonemasons of Germany united to form a Grand Guild, governed by four Head Lodges, of which Strasburg was the chief. So close are the parallels between its organization and that of modern speculative Masonry that many German writers have held that the Steinmetzen were the originators of the speculative system. As a matter of fact there appears to have been no interchange in modern times between the two corporations, and modern German Craft Masonry is clearly derived from England.* (^Gould, Concise History, pp. 18, 24.)

THE ENGLISH GUILDS

Three distinct lines of tradition contribute to the Masonry of the English guilds. One line was preserved among the Celts, as we have already seen, and became mingled in later times with streams from other sources. Secondly, the Roman Collegia survived to some extent in England after the departure of the Romans; the Saxons found them there and did not interfere with them.* (^Coote - cited in The Cathedral Builders, Leader Scott, p. 140.) Thirdly, there was the influx of Continental builders, beginning in the time of S. Augustine, but greatly augmented after the Norman Conquest under the patronage of Archbishop Lanfranc, the first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, a Lombard by birth and a celebrated patron of building even before he came to England.* (^J. S. M. Ward, Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods, p. 147.) All these streams of tradition were represented in the mediaeval guilds, and were handed down in various centres. The French craft-guilds preserve accounts similar to those found in our English Old Charges regarding the assistance given to Masons by Charles Martel.* (^Gould, Concise History, p. 30.)

The secret Mysteries of the Craft, common, save for certain unimportant local modifications, to all these lines of descent, Celtic, Saxon and Continental, were handed down in the Lodges of the mediaeval Masons, which were the units of organization and labour within the guilds; they were never written down, but were transmitted orally from generation to generation, the succession passing down from Master to Master as in the present day. The primary work of the Lodges was of course operative, and the speculative ritual which was handed drown so faithfully in essentials was regarded as an ancient heritage to be scrupulously transmitted to posterity; but it is unlikely that any but the few recognized its true purpose, or thought of it as containing more than a merely moral code of life. It is due to the rigid observance of the O. “never to write those secrets” (an O. which would have been enforced by certain pains and penalties not unknown to Masons today), that no trace of the ritual can be found in any document prior to 1717; and it is because of this lack of all records that many Masonic scholars believe that it was compiled only at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Even in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when the Old Charges were written down, no mention is made of the Legend of Hiram; for this formed part of the secret ritual and therefore might not be divulged. A figure representing God the Son in the porch of Peterborough Cathedral is depicted as making the F.C.H.S.* (^J. S. M. Ward, Op. cit., p. 116.) showing that this s … at least was known to our old operative brethren.

THE RISE OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE

The climax of mediaeval operative building was reached in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the rise and development of Gothic architecture, which was inspired directly by the Head of all true Freemasons throughout the world, as part of the plan for the development of the fifth or Teutonic sub-race. Many theories have been advanced to account for the rapid development of the new style.

Whether the wonderful change of style that in a few years spread over a great part of Western Christendom was due primarily to the discovery of the possibilities of the pointed arch or those of the so-called ogival vaulting is much disputed. Probably it was due to both, and also of course to certain movements, social and political, which were bound to favour immensely any such new enthusiasm; for a new national consciousness was rapidly gaining strength, especially in France, and cities and communes were beginning to vie in erecting vast buildings - first cathedrals and later civic edifices - the architects being now mostly laymen, the founders and donors often municipal bodies and rich citizens, and the workmen not seldom volunteers from the people. The old monastic era of Romanesque suddenly gave way to that of a new, popular, and civic architecture, and in a surprisingly short time much the same had happened as that which we noted after the passing of the fateful year A.D. 1000, when, according to old Raoul Glaber, Christendom cast aside its outworn attire and put on a fresh white robe of new-built Churches.* (^Cotterill, History of Art, Vol. I, p. 278.)

We, however, do not need to speculate or theorize as to the causes of the rapid development of the new style, for we have the advantage of knowing that the movement was all the time being definitely steered from behind by the H.O.A.T.F. and a corps of able assistants under  his direction.

As I have already said, architecture has a powerful effect upon the consciousness of the people, for it is one of the means chosen by the White Lodge to influence the development of the various nations according to the plan of the Great Architect of the Universe. To understand the significance of the Gothic style, we must consider for a moment an important fact of occult history, that which is technically known to students as the cyclic change of Ray. The seven rays, or types of the divine consciousness and activity, to one or other of which all  living things belong, influence the world in turn, and this cyclic change produces the modifications of outlook which are to be noted as century succeeds century.

Each race and sub-race has its own especial qualities to develop. The fifth root-race, to which we ourselves belong, is engaged as a whole in the unfolding of intellect; but each of its sub-races has likewise a quality to cultivate. The fourth or Celtic sub-race was concerned with the evolution of intellect through the emotions, and so produced the beauty-loving peoples whom we see in Greece and Ireland; while the fifth or Teutonic sub-race, to which the Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians belong, is striving to awaken the intellect working in the concrete mind, and so is producing the scientific and industrial nations which lead the world to-day.

This cyclic change of Ray, which is also part of the great plan, produces other, but no less definite modifications in the corporate consciousness. In Greece we saw something of the fifth ray, the ray of knowledge, working upon the fourth sub-race with its love of beauty, resulting in that intellectual type of art so characteristic of the classical age; the Middle Ages show forth the qualities of the sixth ray, the ray of devotion, working upon the fifth or Teutonic sub-race, and producing as its characteristic intellectual fruit scholastic philosophy with its hair-splitting intellectuality based upon an almost fanatical devotion.

Devotion, indeed, was the great characteristic of the Middle Ages. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries, so rich in the annals of Christian mysticism, were adorned by men and women whose power of devotion reached heights rarely touched in any other age. The great S. Bernard (who among many other noted works gave their Rule to the Order of Knights Templars), Richard of S. Victor, S. Hildegarde, S. Francis of Assisi and S. Antony of Padua, and a little later S. Bonaventura and S. Thomas Aquinas - all these have shone forth as a light unto many generations. Profound changes took place in the Catholic Church during these significant years, and Europe rose from the dark ages into the full glory of an era of culture and art. Gothic architecture was intended to lift the devotion of the masses to greater heights than had been induced by the contemplation of the flatter Romanesque style; by its soaring lines and ever-ascending curves, by the richness of its ornamentation and the splendid complexity of its design, by its amazing grace and delicacy, it had power to raise the hearts of men on the wings of its silent music to the very throne of God Himself, to mould and enrich their devotion in unseen subtle ways, to pour out upon them spiritual influences which would aid in the great work of transformation which had to be accomplished.

The change from Romanesque to Gothic, then, was brought about deliberately. The inspiration was given to certain master-builders in the different countries by the H.O.A.T.F., and the erection of the splendid cathedrals of the period was carried out by travelling bands of Masons passing from centre to centre, and doubtless employing the local builders upon the actual work of construction. This, as we have said, was an age of devotion, and every stone was carved with the utmost care to the glory of God, and thereby charged with the adoration of the skilful craftsmen who worked so unselfishly. The powerful spiritual influences generated by all this loving care have contributed in no small degree to the extraordinary beauty of the Gothic cathedrals, and to the power which they possess even in the present day of evoking devotion and reverence from all who approach them.

The particular expressions of Gothic vary in the different countries, and even in different parts of the same country; that is always the case in every style of building. But behind the whole order of Gothic architecture there is one great idea, that of soaring, passionate devotion ever rising to the feet of God; and that is found with national modifications in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This was the great age of operative Masonry, and at its close the building corporations began to decline in power, until in England and Germany especially the movement miscalled the Reformation killed out ecclesiastical architecture, and church building as a fine art practically ceased.

In the fourteenth century the merchant guilds, which organized an entire industry, became decentralized, and a new system of craft guilds gradually arose, organizing different branches of each industry. This change of organization was due to a profound change of thought among the people, which was to lead to the great stirring of the Renaissance and the growth of national consciousness in the different countries. It is at this period that the Old Charges of our ancient operative Brn. first appear, and they were written down as the Freemasons became gradually disorganized, in order to preserve the older oral records from oblivion.

THE OLD CHARGES

These Old Charges reflect in no small measure the ignorance of the time in matters of geography and chronology, but they nevertheless contain an account of the broad outline of Masonic descent from Egypt, through Judaea, into Europe; and it would certainly be difficult to suppose that they were fabricated by mere operative builders who had nothing of hidden mystery to transmit. I give below a brief summary of the Dowland manuscript, which is fairly representative of the tradition common to all. It is reproduced from Hughan’s Old Charges (1872), and is quoted from Mackey’s Encyclopaedia.* (^Art. Legend of the Craft.)

The legend begins with an account of Lamech and his four children, who founded all the sciences of the world before the flood. These sciences were engraved on two pillars, one of which was later found by Hermes, who taught its contents to the people. Nimrod is next mentioned as having employed Masons at the building of the Tower of Babel, and as having given them their first Charge. Next Abraham and Sarah are said to have taught the seven sciences to the Egyptians, and especially to a “worthy Scoller that hight Ewclyde”. The latter was commissioned by the king to teach Masonry to a large number of children of “the lord and estates of the realm”. The legend passes then to David, who, when he began the temple of Jerusalem, learned the Charges and manners of Masons from Egypt and gave them to his people. Solomon continued the building of the temple after David’s death, sent for Masons from all lands, and confirmed the Charges given by his father. There is no reference to the legend of the 3° in any of the Old Charges before the second edition of Anderson’s Constitutions, published in 1738, except that Aynon, the son of Iram, is mentioned as being the “chiefe Maister” of all Masons, and “Master of all his gravings and carvinge and of all other manner of Masonrye that longed to the temple”. The legend, in defiance of all chronology, then states that, “one curious Mason that hight Maymus Grecus”, who had been at the making of Solomon’s temple, taught Masonry to Charles Martel of France. Since the latter died in A.D. 741, the former would have been about seventeen hundred years old, unless we are to understand that the Charge assumes that he had reincarnated!

A legendary account is given of S. Albans work for Masons in the third century, and especially of his institution of General Assemblies. He is also said to have obtained for them a Charter, to have given them Charges, and to have arranged for better pay. Later, Athelstan is said to have built many abbeys and towers, and to have “loved well masons”. His son Edwin, who loved them still more, held an Assembly at York and gave them a Charter. All the old writings were collected at this period, “some in Frenche, and some in Greek, and some in English, and some in other languages; and the intent of them all was founded all one”. These old writings were digested into the York Constitutions which resulted from this Assembly of A.D. 926. It is from this source that we draw the material now embodied in the Old Charges.

2      THE TRANSITION FROM OPERATIVE TO SPECULATIVE

THE REFORMATION

THE dawn of a new era was heralded by the Renaissance of classical learning and culture in the fifteenth century, a time of immense creative activity, of the bursting of bonds, of the liberation of a new and vital spirit of freedom, the direct result of which was what it is the fashion to call the Reformation. The cause of this change and reconstruction was a general reaction against the spirit of the Middle Ages.

The Renaissance originated in that longing for emancipation from the shackles of the past which is probably felt by every new generation, and which now and then, favoured by special conditions, succeeds in realizing its ideals. … The ideals in this case were joy and liberty and personality, liberation from mediaeval asceticism, mediaeval priestcraft, mediaeval dogma; liberation from the anathema that had rested on the natural rights of man - on freedom of  thought and on moral judgment; liberation from traditional law and self-constituted authority, and the restoration to the individual of intellectual and moral self-rule.* (^Cotterill. History of Art, Vol. i, p. 390.)

One of the factors which helped to bring about this great revival of learning was the overthrow of the Eastern Empire by the Muhammadans, the capture of Constantinople and the conquest of Greece, driving all who possessed the means to take refuge in Italy. Many scholars came to Italy at this time, bringing with them precious manuscripts of the old Greek writers; and the restoration of classical learning, classical building and classical art is the most notable feature of the Renaissance. The invention of printing made possible a wider diffusion of learning, and a wave of creative enthusiasm swept over Europe, leaving its mark upon the art, literature and philosophy of the age, and indeed making all things new.

It was obvious to the thinking men of the period that a reform of the Church was essential, for corruption and abuses of all kinds had crept into her sanctuaries. At first an attempt was made towards a broader view of Christian doctrine from within the Roman Church, and scholars, such as Ficino, the Platonists of Italy, Erasmus, and Sir Thomas More, sought to reinterpret Christianity in the light of the philosophy of Plato and Plotinus. But this attempt failed; and, in consequence, the Reformation took place outside the Church in the sixteenth century. It was an attempt to purify the Church from her abuses, to bring her teachings into closer harmony with the new ideas; but it must be admitted that it did little to improve matters from the spiritual point of view, even though it won freedom of belief and liberty for the individual intellect to search for the truth in its own way. For so great was the ignorance and bigotry of the reformers that they cast aside the good with the evil, and framed a theology more intolerable than that of Rome, while to a great extent rejecting her sacramental and contemplative treasures.

THE REAPPEARANCE OF SPECULATIVE MASONRY

After the Reformation in England ecclesiastical architecture practically ceased as an activity of the guilds, and the operative Lodges fell into decay since their work was no longer needed. But while the Reformation thus injured operative Masonry, it made Europe safe for the re-emergence into comparative publicity of the speculative art. The guilds had always accepted rich and influential patrons, and there was nothing new in the introduction of theoretic Masons into the Lodges. Some have denied the possibility of any speculative Masonry existing before the revival; but speculation was the rule rather than the exception in all the guilds, not only the Masonic, and in that devotional age workmen of all trades might be found moralizing upon the instruments of their labour.

But between the period when operative Masonry was at the height of its power and inspiration and the revival of the speculative art at the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was a dark period in which the light of Masonry, both operative and speculative, seemed almost extinguished. Many of the operative Lodges had lost nearly all trace of ritual workings, and had forgotten the traditional secrets of building no less than the ancient secrets of the building symbolism. It is to this period of darkness and decay as well as to the O. not to write those secrets, that we may attribute the paucity of records referring to the mystery-tradition among so many of the old operative Lodges; but by the guidance of the Great Ones this was nevertheless definitely preserved, and transmitted from various sources into our modern Craft.

THE FIRST MINUTES

It is during this post-Reformation period, when the old Lodges had almost forgotten the glory of their heritage, both operative and speculative, that we first find actual minutes of Lodge Meetings. These minutes show the condition into which the Craft had fallen at the time; they are, as we should expect, almost silent upon all questions of ritual, secrets and symbolism, although there are occasional indications which point to the concealment of a hidden tradition. It is in this period also that the first public references to the secrets of the Freemasons occur in contemporary literature; and we are able by means of them to trace to some extent the gradual emergence of the speculative Mysteries.

SCOTTISH MINUTES

The oldest Lodge Minute extant at the present time is contained in  the records of the Lodge of Edinburgh, Mary’s Chapel, No. 1 upon the roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and is dated 1598. We know that it had been the custom from the earliest times for the operative  Lodges to “accept” nonoperative Brethren; but the first authentic record of this is contained in the same archives, which state that John Boswell of Auchinlech was admitted in the year 1600* (^History of the Lodge of Edinburgh, D. Murray-Lyon, p. 53.) The signature of Boswell, a facsimile of which is given in Murray-Lyon’s admirable History, is followed by his mark, a cross within a circle - a symbol often used by the Brn. of the Rosy Cross, and bearing a profound meaning in connection with their Mysteries. One of the earliest  references to the Rosy Cross in Great Britain occurs in Scotland and in connection with Masonry; for in Henry Adamson’s The Muses’ Threnodie (dated Perth, 1638) we find the words:

For what we do presage is riot in grosse,

For we are brethren of the Rosie Cross,

We have the Mason Word and second sight.

Things for to come we can fortell aright.

The Rosicrucian Manifestos, which are the first literary memorials of the order (c. 1614), were not translated and published in English until 1652, when Thomas Vaughan, the celebrated alchemist and  mystic, who wrote under the name of Eugenius Philalethes and has  now become an Adept of the White Lodge, undertook the task;* (^The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, A: E. Waite, p. 375.) so as early as 1638 Masonry was associated both with the Rosicrucian Brotherhood and with the occult power known as second sight. The connection of the Rosy Cross with Masonry belongs to our next chapter.

The Mason Word is the only secret alluded to in early Lodge Minutes in Scotland. What it was is still unknown, although there are curious indications emanating from two writers who did not belong to the Craft. The Rev. George Hickes, afterwards Dean of Worcester, describes it about 1678 as “a secret signal masons have thro’out the world to know one another by”. Robert Kirk in 1691 says that it is:

Lyke a Rabbinical Tradition, in way of Comment on Jachin and Boaz, the two Pillars erected in Solomon’s Temple (I. Kings vii, 21), with an Addition of some secret signe delivered from Hand to Hand, by which the know and become familiar one with another.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 183.)

So far had the Craft forgotten its traditions in Scotland that it seems clear that only one degree existed, so far as the communication of secrets was concerned. The Mason Word was revealed to Apprentices, under a “Great Oath”, and it is probable that a Charge was read, but there is no other indication of ritual procedure. The attainment of the grade of Fellow of the Craft or Master was merely a question of age and skill, and it is ordered in the Schaw Statutes of 1598 that admission to it should take place in the presence of Apprentices, thus precluding any secrets peculiar to the Degree.* (^History of the Lodge of Edinburgh. D. Murray-Lyon, p. 10.) As the years passed by more and more non-operatives were admitted into the Scottish Lodges, until the speculative element entirely predominated.

ENGLISH MINUTES

An indication of the secret transmission of speculative masonry is found in the Lodge of the Acception attached to the Masons’ Company of London, whose records go back to 1356.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 105.) We first hear of that Lodge in 1620-21, when it was clearly a body distinct from the Company, for the King’s Master Mason, Nicholas Stone, though Master of the Company in 1633, and again in 1634, was not enrolled among the  “Accepted Masons” until 1639.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 111.) Persons not belonging to the Company were also eligible for admission, although from them a higher fee was demanded for the privilege of initiation. Elias Ashmole, the celebrated student of alchemy, who collected certain texts upon this abstruse science in his Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, was initiated into a non-operative Lodge at Warrington in Lancashire in 1646.* (^Ibid., p. 112.) In 1682 he received a summons to attend a Lodge at Masons’ Hall in London - which was almost certainly the Acception - and was present at the initiation of six candidates, two of whom were not members of the Masons’ Company.* (^Ibid., p. 116.)

Elias Ashmole has sometimes been cited as the real founder of speculative Masonry, and also as a Bro. of the Rosy Cross; the latter suggestion is possible, although no evidence exists upon the point, but the former cannot of course be accepted by those who hold that Masonry has descended from the ancient Mysteries. A speculation is put forward by Bro. A. E. Waite in a recent book, connecting the Acception with Robert Fludd, the great English Rosicrucian Philosopher (1576-1637). He says:

However and whenever it arose, my thesis is that the Acception may have included a group of Hermetic Students, of which there were many at the period; that Fludd drew them together or took his place among them; and that - after his manner and the manner of the Rosy Cross - they began to speak of spiritual building in a Hall of Masons, of a Hermetic Art in stone; and that therefore they may have contributed something to our own unfinished sketch of figurative building.* (^Emblematic Freemasonry, p. 43.)

Among the records of the Acception was a Book of Constitutions “which Mr. Flood gave”.

In the Harleian MSS., No. 2054, a rough memorandum of date 1665 is found, containing the following sentence, which looks like notes of an Obligation, used probably in the Chester Lodge:

There is seu`all word and signes of a free Mason to be revailed to yu wch as yu will anew: before God at the great and terrible day of Iudgmt yu keep Secret and not to revaile the same to any in the heares of any pson w but to the Mrs and fellows of the said Society of free Masons so helpe me God, xt.* (^Ibid., p. 115.)

Dr. Robert Plot in his Natural History of Staffordshire (Chap. iii), published in 1686, refers to the admission of Masons, “which cheifly consists in the communication of certain secret signes, whereby they are known to one another all over the Nation.” He also speaks of “a large parchment volum they have amongst them containing the History and Rules of the craft of masonry.”* (^Emblematic Freemasonry, p. 119.) In the Aubrey MSS. of the Natural  History of Wiltshire Dr. Plot refers to the adoption of Sir Christopher Wren as a Freemason.* (^Ibid., p. 120.) The Minutes of Lodge Antiquity No. 2, the old Lodge which met at the Goose and Gridiron, dated 1723, refer to a set of candlesticks which “its worthy old Master, Sir Christopher Wren” presented to the Lodge.* (^The Builders, Vol. x, No. 2, p. 55.)

The “old Lodge at York City” was in a flourishing condition in 1705, but there is no documentary evidence to show its earlier history, though a Logium Fabricae is mentioned in the Fabric Rolls of York Minster in 1352. From 1705, and perhaps before, the York Lodge was exclusively the home of speculative or symbolical Masonry. The earliest minutes preserved are in a parchment roll dated 1712-1730. The greater number of meetings are described as Private while a few are referred to as General Lodges, although Candidates were apparently admitted at both. New members were “Sworne and Admitted” - the only documentary trace of any ritual working.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 122.) As we shall see, the York Lodge proclaimed itself the “Grand Lodge of All England” in 1725, eight years after the foundation of the Grand Lodge of England, and only a few months after the Grand Lodge of Ireland was formed; it lingered somnolently until the closing years of the eighteenth century, when it seems to have been silently absorbed into the bosom of its rivals. Anderson in his Constitutions of 1738 refers to Grand Lodges which derived from other sources than the Grand Lodge of England, and gives them definite recognition:

But the old Lodge at York City, and the Lodges of Scotland, Ireland, France, and Italy, affecting Independency, are under their own Grand Masters, though they have the same Constitutions, Charges, Regulations, etc., for substance, with their Brethren of England.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 197.)

This is a significant statement, for Lodges “affecting independency,” one of which is admittedly “old,” do not take kindly to innovations from outside their ranks. If any proof is required that Masonry was not the invention of Anderson, we have it here in his own words.

Two of Steel’s essays in The Tatler in 1709 and 1710 refer to the existence of signs and tokens among the Freemasons. In the Minutes of the Old Lodge at York and of Mary’s Chapel at Edinburgh there is evidence of the proving of Brn. before they were admitted to the Lodge, the latter entry referring to no less a person than Dr. Desaguliers, who in 1721 was found qualified in all points of Masonry by his Scottish Brn. - an incident showing identity of secrets between the Scottish and the English Lodges.* (^History of the Lodge of Edinburgh. D. Murray-Lyon, p. 159.) The same gradual transition from operative to non-operative membership took place in the English as in the Scottish Lodges, and it was this infiltration of educated and cultured men which made possible the momentous events of 1717.

IRISH MINUTES

Irish Masonry presents certain difficulties of research; for it was a point of honour among Irish Masons in the eighteenth century to destroy all documents, warrants, certificates, Lodge registers and minute books, rather than that they should pass into the hands of outsiders.* (^Dr. Chetwode Crawley. A. Q. C., xvi, 69.) Dr. Chetwode Crawley states that there was a speculative Lodge of the English type at Doneraile in 1710-12, which used methods of initiation not to be distinguished from those perpetuated at the revival. Into this Lodge Elizabeth St. Leger, the famous lady Mason, was initiated, and it must have worked at least two degrees. Dr. Crawley remarks:

This last deduction will require a good deal of explaining away on the part of those Brethren who hold that, because early Scottish operative Lodges suffered the ritual to dwindle into the merest mode of recognition, the early English speculative Lodges cannot have worked more than one degree.* (^A. Q. C., viii, 55.)

This period of transition forms the connecting link between the old dispensation and the new. The day of operative Masonry as practised in the mediaeval Lodges was over; that of speculative Masonry as we know it to-day had not yet begun. No longer was there need of secrecy; the dread of death and torture no longer compelled the servants of the Hidden Light to take refuge in the workshops of the builders in stone. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of action had at last been won. And as in the twilight that precedes the dawn we may discern the faint mysterious outlines of some lovely landscape hidden beneath the robe of darkness, till, as the light of the rising sun glows stronger and yet stronger, they are clothed with richer colour and beauty; so in this age of twilight we may glimpse in the outer  world the dim shadows of the Hidden Mysteries as they emerge from their long night of secrecy and silence into the freedom of the day, and the Royal Art is seen once more of men.

THE GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND

The only extant record of the founding of the Premier Grand Lodge of the world occurs in the second edition of Dr. Anderson’s Constitutions, published in 1738. No minute of Grand Lodge itself has been traced before the year 1723.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 204.) The following is part of the account therein given of this important event in the history of Craft Masonry:

After the Rebellion was over, A.D. 1716, the few Lodges at London. … thought fit to cement under a Grand Master as the centre of Union and Harmony, viz., the Lodges that met,

At the Goose and Gridiron Ale-house in St. Paul’s Church-yard.

At the Crown Ale-house in Parker’s Lane, near Drury-Lane.

At the Apple-Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Covent Garden.

At the Rummer and Grapes Tavern in Channel-Row, Westminster.

“They and some old Brothers met at the said Apple-Tree, and having put into the Chair the oldest Master Mason (now the Master of a Lodge), they constituted themselves a Grand Lodge pro Tempore in Due Form, and forthwith  revived the Quarterly Communication of the Officers of lodges (called the GRAND LODGE), resolv’d to hold the Annual ASSEMBLY and Feast, and then to chuse a GRAND MASTER from among themselves, till they should  have the Honour of a Noble Brother at their Head.” The Grand Lodge was according formed on S. John the Baptist’s Day 1717, with Anthony Sayer as the First Grand Master.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 201.)

Bro. Calvert has demonstrated that the first three Lodges were probably composed of operative Masons, and numbered about fifteen Brethren each, while the fourth Lodge had a roll of seventy members and was the speculative Lodge, to which all the leading men of the Craft belonged in the early days, including Payne Anderson and Desaguliers, and a large and influential body of noblemen.* (^A. F. Calvert. The Grand Lodge of England, cited in The Builders, Vol.  x, p. 84.)

At first very little seems to have been done, and it does not appear that the original founders of the Grand Lodge had the least idea of starting a world-movement; but with the advent of the Duke of Montague to the Grand Master’s Chair in 1721, the Society rose into fame and success at one bound.

The first task was the compilation and ‘digesting’ of the Old Gothic Constitutions, which as we have seen had been handed down in the Lodges from operative times; and this was done by Anderson in 1721. The Constitutions were printed in 1723, and a subsequent and somewhat altered edition in 1738, when the speculative system was firmly established under Grand Lodge auspices. George Payne, the second Grand Master, drafted the regulations, Anderson ‘digested’ the general  subject matter after ‘a new and better manner’, Dr. Desaguliers, the third Grand Master, wrote the Preface and Dedication, and the fourth Grand Master, the Duke of Montague, ordered the book to be printed after its formal approval by the Grand Lodge.* (^Ibid., p. 205.)

Perhaps the most important feature of these Constitutions is the definite removal of all religious barriers to membership in the Order. Our ancient operative Brn. had, of course, been Christians and Catholics; but now the universality of the Mysteries was again to be demonstrated by the excision of all sectarian limitations. The language in which this was expressed is not happy; but it is possible that some inspiration may have been given upon this point, for it was certainly in accordance with the policy of the White Lodge. Masonry is indeed the heart of all religions, and should be bound definitely to none; although every Mason is at liberty to profess whatever faith may be most congenial to him, since they are all facets of the truth.

THE RECOMPOSITION OF THE RITUALS

Much debate and controversy has taken place among Masonic writers with regard to the origin of our modern speculative rituals, of which there is no documentary trace before the revival in 1717. That there was a definite Masonic Ceremonial in existence at this time we learn from Dr. Stukely, who tells us that “his curiosity led him to be initiated into the mysterys of Masonry, suspecting it to be the remains of the mysterys of the antients”.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 54.) He was initiated into the Order on January 6th, 1721, and says: “I was the first person made a freemason for many years. We had great difficulty to find members enough to perform the ceremony.”* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 223.) The Manningham Letters also offer testimony that the rituals of speculative Masonry belong to an earlier period than 1717. Dr. Manningham, Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England, writes in 1757 of:

One old Brother of Ninety, who I conversed with lately; this Brother assures me He was made a Mason in his youth, and has constantly frequented Lodges, till rend’red incapable by his advanc’d Age, and never heard, or knew, any other Ceremonies or Words, than those us’d in general amongst us; such Forms were deliver’d to him, and those he has retain’d.* (^Ibid., p. 249.)

This testimony is significant, for a Mason ninety years old in 1757 would have been fifty years of age in 1717, so that if he was initiated in his youth, our ceremonies must date at least from the last half of the seventeenth century. It will be remembered that the judgment of R. F. Gould is precise upon this matter:

If we once get beyond or behind the year 1717, i.e. , into the domain of ancient Masonry, and again look back, the vista is perfectly illimitable, without a speck or shadow to break the continuity of view which is presented to us.* (^R. F. Gould. A. Q. C. xvi, 30.)

The decay of the operative Lodges, noted earlier in this chapter, had a disastrous effect upon the ancient ritual which had been handed down orally from Lodge to Lodge and from Master to Master from the days of the Roman Collegia. No word of it might ever be written, and it had to be learnt by heart by the Masters and officers of the Lodges. By the time, however, that we reach the days of the revival, this oral tradition had become much corrupted, and although the ancient ritual actions were still remembered, the words accompanying them had degenerated into mere verbal jargon, often quite unintelligible to those who recited it. One example will be sufficient to indicate the state of affairs. Several inns in England are named “The Goat and Compasses,” and as it stands the phrase has no meaning, unless it be taken to refer to the perennial fable of the “riding of the goat”. The real derivation is from the words “God encompasses us,” degenerated into “Goat and Compasses”. It was into a somewhat analogous state that the whole ritual had fallen in the days of Anderson and Desaguliers, who after the founding of the new Grand Lodge set to work to bring order out of chaos.

They proceeded to collect and revise all the workings known to them, clothing the skeleton of the ritual in the eighteenth century English so familiar in our ears to-day. On the whole their task was well carried out, and although many losses had occurred before 1717, the portion which Anderson brought with him was fairly representative of the general chaos. Anderson was clearly not a man of genius, though he did his best, and it may well be a matter of regret that the stilted language of that dullest of dull periods should have been chosen to clothe the ancient Mysteries rather than the inspired and stately English of a century before. But taverns are not conducive to spiritual inspiration, and it was in taverns that this rebirth of the Mysteries took place.

TWO AND THREE DEGREES

At first it would appear that only two degrees were worked, for the Constitutions of 1723 (Regulation xiii), speak of “Apprentices,” and of “Masters and Fellow-Craft” who could only be made in Grand Lodge “unless by a Dispensation”.* (^The Constitutions of Freemasons (Bi-centenary Ed.), p. 61.) This rule was repealed in 1725, when Grand Lodge enacted that “the Master of Each Lodge, with the Consent of his Wardens and the Majority of the Brethren, being Masters, may make Masters at their discretion”.* (^A. Q. C., xvi, p. 38.) There is in this same year a mention of three degrees in the working of the “Grand Lodge of All England” at York, when a speech was delivered by Dr. Francis Drake, Junior Grand Warden, in which he mentions E.A., F.C., and M.M.R.F. Gould holds that the “Apprentice Part consisted of what we now know as the 1° and 2° and that the Master’s Part” was our 3°, containing the legend of Hiram.* (^A. Q. C., xvi, p. 36.)

He considers it settled beyond dispute:

Not only that what we now call the Third Degree existed before the era of Grand Lodges, but that, having passed through a long decline, its symbols had become corrupted, and their meaning (to a great extent) forgotten, when the step itself - then known as the “Master’s Part” - is first heard of (i.e., unequivocally referred to) in any print or manuscript to which a date can be assigned (1723).* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 223.)

It seems probable that the original workings may have been compressed into two degrees, and the subsequent division into three degrees may well have been a rearrangement of the material in accordance with ancient tradition. Evidence for the working of three grades of  Masonry occurs as early as 1725 in London in the Transactions of the Philo-Musicae et Architecturae Societas in which certain brethren are recorded as “regularly passed Masters,” “regularly passed Fellow Crafts” and “regularly passed fellow Craft and Master,” although it  is not clearly known exactly what took place.* (^Ibid., p. 228.) By 1738 the procedure in the Lodges seems to have been generally similar to that known among us to-day.

OPPOSITION

That there was at first some distrust and dislike of the new movement, upon the part of older Masons, is certain. In the second edition of the Constitutions (1738) Anderson tells us that in 1720:

At some private Lodges, several very valuable Manuscripts (for they had nothing yet in print) concerning the Fraternity, their Lodges, Regulations, Charges, Secrets, and Usages (particularly one writ by Mr. Nicholas Stone, the Warden of Inigo Jones) were too hastily burnt by some scrupulous Brothers, that these Papers might not fall into strange Hands.* (^A. Q. C., xvi, p. 33. See ante. Page 246)

We know that there were other Lodges not at first included in the Grand Lodge, and it may well be that certain of the older Brn. viewed the new venture with suspicion, and destroyed their records to prevent them from falling into the hands of innovators. There is a suggestion, too, that other traditions were preserved elsewhere in greater fullness, as we shall see in connection with the schism of the “Antients”. But although the Grand Lodge was inaugurated humbly enough, it soon began to attract attention under the Duke of Montague, and its success as a movement was immediately established.

THE SUCCESSION OF I.M.s

The succession of I.M.s was preserved under the new dispensation, although there is little trace in London of a definite degree in the sense of ritual working. Such a degree was part of the authorized working of the “Ancients” in 1751, though it was not adopted by the “Moderns” until 1810.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 225.) The actual power, however, was transmitted by the act of installation which forms the essential part of the sacrament, and we  learn from the “Manner of Constituting a New Lodge according to the ancient Usages of Masons” given in the Constitutions of 1723, that after the new Master had submitted to the Charges of a Master “as Masters have done in all ages,” the Grand Master shall “by certain  significant Ceremonies and ancient Usages, install him”.* (^The Constitutions of Freemasons (Bi-centenary Ed.), p. 72.)

THE GRAND LODGES OF YORK, IRELAND AND SCOTLAND

But although the impulse towards revival clearly originated in London with the erection of the Grand Lodge of England, the Apple-Tree Tavern was not the only temple of the Mysteries. Other Lodges existed both in England and the sister-kingdoms, and other equally valid streams of tradition began to emerge in different centres. York was for unnumbered years a powerful and hallowed sanctuary of speculative Masonry; and the “old Lodge” at York proclaimed itself a Grand Lodge in 1725. It is even possible that it may have called itself such before, for there is written testimony in 1778 from the then York Grand Secretary to the effect that the Grand Lodge at York antedated the Lodge of London by twelve or more years.* (^A. E. Waite. Emblematic Freemasonry, p. 59.)

It is clear that ancient York workings existed, and that something of their tradition, passing through Irish and “Ancient” Masonry, is with us to-day, blended with the traditions inherited from Anderson. York has a glamour about its ancient walls like that which surrounds Kilwinning and the sanctuary which was Heredom; to York also we must look for one of the guardian-centres of our Mysteries.

It is clear from a study of Irish Masonry and that of the “Ancients,” which was so closely allied to it, that more was handed down from the past than the three Blue degrees; for the latter on their own showing are not complete without the symbolism preserved for us in the Holy Royal Arch and other similar degrees, which did not, it would seem, emerge in the South. The first mention of the Holy Royal Arch comes from Youghal in Ireland in 1743; the second emanates from York in 1744. The “Ancients,” though they had nothing to do with the “Grand Lodge of All England” at York, nevertheless persistently refer to themselves as York Masons, thus claiming kinship with the York tradition.

On the other hand, Murray Lyon shows that the records reveal no traces of ritual procedure or of speculative Masonry as we know it to-day until after the foundation of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717, and that the speculative ritual was derived from England after that event. No evidence exists to show that Lodge Kilwinning, the second Lodge in Scotland according to the Schaw Statutes, whose extant Minutes go back to 1642, ever worked any degrees other than those belonging to Craft Masonry, either before or after the formation of the Grand Lodge.

A Past Master of Lodge Canongate Kilwinning draws my attention to a serious mistake which I made in The Hidden Life in Freemasonry (p. 119) in describing that historic Lodge as founded in 1723. He says:

Lodge Canongate Kilwinning No. 2 received a Charter from the Mother Lodge at Kilwinning in Ayrshire (now known as Lodge Mother Kilwinning No. 0) dated 20th December, 1677, and recorded in the Minutes of Kilwinning Lodge on that date.

The Lodge history tells us that:

At the beginning of the eighteenth century the Lodge numbered amongst its members the foremost noblemen and gentlemen of Scotland who were devoted to the Stuart cause.

The unsuccessful rising in 1715 sent those who had escaped death on the battlefield into exile: and during the confusion attendant on those times, the whole early records of the Lodge were lost or destroyed, and no trace of them can now be found. At length the survivors, a small but trusty band, met about the beginning of 1735 and resumed the meetings.

The earliest Minute in preservation is dated 13th February, 1735, and begins:

Cannongate, Feby. ye 13th A.D. 1735 A.M. 5735.

The Lodge having met according to adjournment do appoint. …

The Lodge is never closed, but adjourned to the next fixed day of meeting.

Most Lodges install on S. John the Evangelist’s Day, 27th December. Lodge Canongate Kilwinning installs on S. John the Baptist’s Day, 24th June. The earliest reference in the Minutes of this (or any Scottish) Lodge to the admission of Master Masons is on 31st March, 1735.

I apologize for the error in my previous book, and will see that it is corrected if a second edition should be needed.

The Grand Lodge of Ireland appears to have come into being in 1725, and the Irish rituals are clearly derived from a somewhat different line of tradition from those preserved in Southern England, being indeed closely allied with the York workings. The Grand Lodge of Scotland was formed in 1736; and here again we find marked differences of ritual and even of secrets, though there is no evidence on the physical plane to show whence this distinctive Scottish Masonry is derived. It is from these three Premier Grand Lodges, and from the Grand Lodge of the Ancients, now amalgamated with the Grand Lodge of England, that all Anglo-Saxon Masonry, and probably much of Continental Masonry also, has sprung. The details of their workings may differ in non-essentials, but the same hallowed Mysteries were the heritage of all, and through them have penetrated into all the world “to be a light to those who sit in darkness” and “to guide their feet into the way of peace”.

THE “ANCIENTS”

As a further indication that the Grand Lodge of England had not inherited the only tradition current in the United Kingdom, we find the schismatic Grand Lodge of the “Ancients” formed in 1751 in London, under the title of the “Grand Lodge of England according to the old Institutions”. The researches of Mr. Henry Sadler into the archives of the Grand Lodge prove that the establishment of this body was due to the activity of a number of Irish Masons resident in London.* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 252.) They claimed affinity with the York tradition, though not with the York Grand Lodge; and it is clear that they differed considerably from the Modern or regular Grand Lodge of England. Their Grand Secretary, Lawrence Dermott, says:

The Ancients under the name of Free and Accepted Masons according to the old Institutions, and the Moderns under the name of Freemasons of England, though similar in name, yet differ exceedingly in makings, ceremonials, knowledge, Masonic language, and installation, so much that they have always been, and still continue to be, two distinctive societies totally independent of each other.* (^Quoted. loc. cit.)

Furthermore he tells us something of the nature of such differences:

A Modern Mason may safely communicate all his secrets to an Ancient Mason, but an Ancient cannot with like safety communicate all his secrets to a Modern Mason without further ceremony. For as a Science comprehends an Art (though an Art cannot comprehend a Science), even so Ancient Masonry contains everything valuable among the Moderns, as well as many other things that cannot be revealed without additional ceremonies.* (^Ibid., p. 256.)

There is little doubt that these differences consisted of changes in the 3°, the degree of I.M., and the Holy Royal Arch; and they are clearly the result of the inheritance of a different stream of Masonic tradition. It is almost certain that the Moderns did make innovations in the ritual; they seem to have exchanged the words of the First and Second Degrees, because of the exposures contained in Samuel Pritchard’s Masonry Dissected, which had an enormous sale in England and on the Continent, and the old order is still preserved in Continental Masonry, especially in Lodges working what is known as the French Rite.

THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH

The first mention in contemporary records of the Holy Royal Arch occurs at Youghal in Ireland in 1743; and we hear of it again in 1744 in Dr. Dassigny’s “Serious and Impartial Enquiry into the cause of the Present Decay of Freemasonry in the Kingdom of Ireland,” in which he tells us of the existence of an Assembly of Royal Arch Masons at York - from which city the degree was introduced into Dublin; that it was known and practised in London “some small space before”; and that the members thereof were “an organis’d body of men who have passed the chair”.* (^Quoted. loc. cit. p. 199.)

We have already seen how in ancient days the Royal Arch was associated with the 3°, as the Mark was with the 2°; and both these items of ceremonial appear to have been included in that corpus of tradition which reached Anderson in 17I7 or thereabouts, and to have been worked in private in certain of the Lodges from time immemorial, although they do not seem to have been formally sanctioned by the Grand Lodge. The first exoteric mention of the Mark Degree occurs in the Minute-Book of a Royal Arch Chapter in Portsmouth in 1769.* (^Quoted. loc. cit., p. 263.) A careful study of existing rituals of both these degrees shows that considerable differences occur in English, Scottish and Irish workings; and it is clear that in their case also many lines of tradition were handed down. Bro. A. E. Waite refers to a ritual of the Old York Mark Lodge in his possession, which differs almost completely from any of our present workings.* (^Emblematic Freemasonry, p. 62, note.) It is not difficult to account for differences of ritual between “Ancients” and “Moderns,” when we consider the number and variety of traditions handed down throughout the ages.

THE UNITED GRAND LODGE

In 1813 the two rival Grand Lodges of England formally united, and thenceforward the United Grand Lodge of England has been the governing body of Craft Masonry in that country. At the union an amalgamation took place between the two lines of tradition, and English Craft Masonry is indebted to Ireland and to York as well as to the Apple-Tree Tavern for its methods of working. According to the Articles of Union already noted it was agreed upon that for the future:

Pure Antient Masonry consists of three degrees, and no more, viz., those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason (including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch). But this Article is not intended to prevent any Lodge or Chapter from holding a meeting in any of the Degrees of the Orders of Chivalry, according to the Constitutions of the said Orders.* (^A. Q. C., xvi, 63.)

In such wise the Masonic tradition became fixed, and it remains the same in essentials to-day.

CRAFT MASONRY IN OTHER COUNTRIES

It is commonly held that Masonry was introduced into France from England about 1732, though some think that it came in seven years earlier under Jacobite auspices. In reality it antedates that era altogether, for Masonic tradition of some sort had existed in France from time immemorial, and when King James II took refuge at Clermont Abbey in 1688 he found a Masonic centre there which he tried unsuccessfully to use for political purposes. Whether the English rite which was brought in at the date above-mentioned linked itself in any way with the indigenous Masonry is uncertain - there is no evidence upon the point - but French Masonry has diverged very considerably from the English workings.

The symbolic or blue degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite appear in many ways to preserve a fuller tradition, and they probably represent another line of descent, for they employ the ancient Chaldaean method of seating the three principal officers in an isosceles triangle. As in the regular Grand Lodge of England prior to 1810, there is no degree of I.M. worked on the Continent, except in bodies deriving authority from the Grand Lodge in London. The elected Master is placed in the Chair without ceremony, as in the older English working. The Grand Lodge of Scotland recognized the ceremonial degree only in 1872. It was derived from sources accessible to the “Ancients,” possibly from York. Certain of the signs of the degree are found on the walls of Egyptian temples, and when its inner or occult side is studied, installation into the Ch.: of K.: S.: is found to have formed part of the genuine and immemorial tradition of the Mysteries.

Masonry is said to have appeared in Germany in 1733, though the first known Lodge was established in Hamburg in 1737; in Sweden it dates from 1735; while Dutch Masonry was inaugurated in 1731, when the Duke of Lorraine was initiated at the Hague by Dr.  Desaguliers.* (^Gould, Concise History, p. 306.) It was introduced into America before 1733, when the first Lodge holding written authority from the Grand Lodge of England was established in Boston.* (^Ibid., p. 333.) It was in reality practised in America before the date of the founding of Grand Lodge, being carried thither by some of the earlier settlers. Many Lodges were constituted with Scottish, Irish and “Ancient” Warrants, which accounts for the many variations to be found in American workings. In America to-day there are over fifty Grand Lodges with a membership of at least two millions, many of whom also belong to various high degree Obediences.* (^Ibid., pp. 348, 349.) There are nine Grand Lodges in Canada, with a hundred and twenty thousand members, and seven Grand Lodges in Australasia, with seventy-five thousand members.* (^Ibid., p. 345.) Craft Masonry flourishes likewise in many other countries, and is unquestionably one of the greatest powers for good in the world in this twentieth century.

2      OTHER LINES OF MASONIC TRADITION

THE STREAM OF SECRET SOCIETIES

IN the name of the Christ, the Lord of love and compassion, that body which called itself His Church and professed to follow Him had established a reign of terror throughout Europe, and plunged into a mad orgy of cruelty and unbridled wickedness such as the world has rarely seen even among the most degraded savages. It was this desperate condition of affairs that made necessary the intentional confusion of the inner truths of Freemasonry with the trade secrets of the operative guilds; but that was not the only method adopted by the Powers behind to carry on the tradition of the Light through those days of more than Cimmerian darkness. There were also certain societies, secret or semisecret, which existed for the express purpose of perpetuating a noble and pure teaching.

Just because they had to work so warily and so quietly it is not easy to find traces of the activity of these organizations; but a very earnest Mason, Mrs. Isabel Cooper-Oakley, has devoted years of patient and laborious original research in many parts of Europe to the study of this subject, and has published the results of her toil in Traces of a Hidden Tradition in Masonry and Mediaeval Mysticism. From that book I extract the following list of mystical societies, interspersed with a few names of individual mystics:

In the third century we find Manes, the widow’s son, the link for all of those who believe in the great work done by the “Sons of the Widow” and the Magian Brotherhood.

In the fourth century the central figure for all occult students is the great Iamblichus, the forerunner of the Rosicrucians.

From the third to the ninth century the following organizations and sects appear; Manichaeans; Euchites; Dionysian Artificers; Ophites; Nestorians; Eutychians, and the Magistri Comacini, of whom we may read in Llorente’s History of the Inquisition, and in Professor Herzario’s I Maestri Comacini. This author says: “In this darkness which extended over all Italy, only one small lamp remained alight, making a bright spark in the vast Italian necropolis. It was from the Magistri Comacini. Their names are unknown, their individual works unspecialized, but the breath of their spirit may be felt all through those centuries, and their name collectively is legion. We may safely say that of all the works of art between 800 and 1000 A.D., the greater and better part are due to that brotherhood - always faithful and often secret - of the Magistri Comacini.”

In the tenth century we find still the Manichaeans and the Euchites; also the Paulicians and the Bogomiles.

Eleventh century: the Cathari and Patarini, condemned by the Roman Church, both derived from the Manichaeans; the Paulicians with the same tradition, also persecuted; the Knights of Rhodes and of Malta; Scholastic Mystics.

Twelfth century: the Albigenses appear, probably derived from Manichaeans who settled in Albi; the Knights Templars, publicly known; the Cathari, widely spread in Italy; the Hermetists.

Thirteenth century: the Brotherhood of the Winkelers; the Apostolikers; the Beghards and the Beguinen; the Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit; the Lollards; the Albigenses, crushed out by the Catholic Church; the Troubadours.

Fourteenth century: the Hesychasts, the precursors of the Quietists; the Friends of God; German Mysticism, led by Nicholas of Basle; Johann Tauler; Christian Rosenkreutz; the great Templar persecution; the Fraticelli.

Fifteenth century: the Fratres Lucis at Florence, also the Platonic Academy; the Alchemical Society; Society of the Trowel; the Templars; the Bohemian Brothers, or Unitas Fratrum; the Rosicrucians.

Sixteenth century: the Rosicrucians became widely known; the Order of Christ, derived from the Templars; Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim, in connection with a secret association; Saint Teresa; S. John of the Cross; Philippe  Paracelsus; the Fire Philosophers; Militia Crucifera Evangelica, under Simon Studion; the Mysteries of the Hermetic Masters.

Seventeenth century: the Rosicrucians; the Templars; the Asiatische Bruder; Academia di Secreti, at the home of John Baptista Porta; the Quietists, founded by Michael de Molinos; and the whole group of Spanish mystics.

Eighteenth century: the Fratres Lucis, or the Knights of Light; the Rosicrucians; the Knights and Brothers Initiate of St. John the Evangelist from Asia, or the Asiatische Bruder; the Martinists; the Theosophical Society, founded in London, 1767, by Benedicte Chastanier, a mystic Mason; the Quietists; the  Knights Templars; some Masonic bodies.

The various sects and bodies here detailed should not be understood as belonging exclusively to the century under which they appear in the above classification. All that this list is intended to convey is that such sects were more markedly prominent during the century in which they are placed.* (^Op. cit., pp. 27-9.)

Yet again Mrs. Cooper-Oakley writes with deep appreciation of the work done by the Troubadours:

From the death of Manes, A.D. 276, there was an intimate alliance - even a fusion - with some of the leading Gnostic sects, and thence do we derive the intermingling of the two richest streams of Oriental Wisdom: the one, directly through Persia from India; the other, traversing that marvellous Egyptian period, enriched by the wisdom of the great Hermetic teachers, flowed into Syria and Arabia, and thence with added force - garnered from the new divine powers made manifest in the profound mystery of the blessed Jesus - into Europe, through Northern Africa, finding a home in Spain, where it took deep root. From this stock sprang into full flower that richness of speech and song for which the Troubadours will live for ever, Manichaeans who sang and chanted the Esoteric Wisdom they dared not speak.

Next we see them dispersed in sects, taking local names - separated in name only, but using the same secret language, having the same signs. Thus, everywhere they journeyed, and no matter by what name they were called, each knew the other as a “widow’s son,” bound together on a Mystic Quest, knitted - by virtue of a secret science - into one community; with them came from the East a chivalric ideal, and they chanted of love and sang of heaven: but the love was a Divine Love, and their heaven was the wisdom and peace of those who sought the higher life.* (^Ibid., p. 124.)

I have taken two long extracts from Mrs. Oakley’s book, because it is the only one of which I know which treats in any detail of these little-known sects. Among them two stand out as better known or at any rate more fully discussed than the others, and both of them have to a considerable extent influenced our modern Masonic rituals, especially those of the higher degrees. These two are the Knights Templars and the Brethren of the Rosy Cross.

THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS

The Order of the Knights Templars, called also the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, was founded in 1118 by Hugues de Payens (Hugo de Paganis), a Knight of Burgundy, and Godefroid de St. Omer a Knight of Northern France, in order to protect the  pilgrims who flocked to the Holy Land after the First Crusade. Baldwin I, King of Jerusalem, allotted to those two knights and six others who joined with them quarters near the site of Solomon’s Temple, whence their name Templars was derived.

Nine years later Hugues de Payens visited Europe with the object of placing the new Order upon a more secure foundation and of gaining recognition and a Rule from the Pope. He secured the enthusiastic support of S. Bernard, the great Abbot of Clairvaux, and in 1128 a Rule, which was drawn up for them by S. Bernard himself, was approved for the Knights Templars by the Council of Troyes. It was not, however, until 1163 that Pope Alexander III issued the charter of the Order, and its organization was fully established.

The Order of the Temple in the days of its glory consisted of various grades. The Knights (fratres milites) formed its most important section, at least from the military point of view; at their reception they were pledged to observe the three evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience,* (^The Reception of a Templar. Bro. E. J. Castle, K. C. in A. Q. C., Vol. xv,  p. 163.) like the members of all other religious orders throughout the Church. The Knights, who were often of high birth, were each entitled to three horses, a squire and two tents. Married men were also received, but only on condition of bequeathing one half of their property to the Order. No women were admitted.

Besides these there was also a body of clergy (fratres capellani) - Bishops, priests and deacons - who were under the same vows as the Knights, and by special dispensation owed obedience to no superior, ecclesiastical or civil, except the Grand Master of the Temple and the Pope. It was laid down that the confessions of brethren of the Order should only be heard by these special clergy; and thus their secrets were guarded inviolate. There were also two classes of Serving Brothers, those bearing arms (fratres servientes armigeri), and the menials and craftsmen (fratres servientes famuli and officii).

At the head of the whole organization stood the Grand Master; next in rank came the Seneschal of the Temple, and the Marshal, the supreme authority in military affairs; and the Order was administered in Provinces under a number of Commanders. After the fall of the Latin Kingdom, the Headquarters of the Order were moved from Jerusalem to Cyprus, and Paris became the chief Templar centre in Europe.

The influence wielded by the Templars grew rapidly. They fought gallantly in the various Crusades, and also became the great international financiers and bankers of the age, thereby amassing vast riches. It is reckoned that before the middle of the thirteenth century they possessed nine thousand manors in Europe alone. The Paris Temple was the centre of the world’s money market, and their influence and wealth in England also were very great. In the later part of that century they are said to have drawn a revenue amounting to nearly 2,500,000  in our money, more than that of any European kingdom or state of that time.* (^Quelques Reflexions sur les Origines de la Franc-Maconnerie Templiere, par  le Grand Commandeur du Supreme Conseil de Belgique (Count Goblet d’Alviella). Bruxelles, 1904, p. 8.) At this period the Templars were believed to number between 15,000 and 20,000 Knights and Clergy; but in attendance upon these there was a veritable army of squires, servants and vassals. Their influence may be estimated from the fact that members of the Order were summoned to the great Councils of the Church, such as the Lateran Council of 1215 and the Council of Lyons of 1274.* (^See also Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. Templars, from which much of the above information is derived.)

The Knights Templars brought back to the West a set of symbols and ceremonies belonging to the Masonic tradition, and they possessed certain knowledge which is now given only in the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The Order was thus one of the repositories of the Hidden Wisdom in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, although the full secrets were given only to the few; alone, therefore, among the religious Orders, their ceremonies of reception were conducted in strict privacy. As was but natural in such an age, the most evil and horrible practices were attributed to the Order because of this secrecy, and stories were told which had absolutely no foundation whatever in fact.

In the Templar form of what we now call the 18°, the Most Wise Sovereign was an ordained priest or Bishop, and the bread and wine which was consecrated in open Chapter in the course of a splendid ceremony was a veritable Eucharist - a wonderful blending of the Egyptian with the Christian sacrament.

THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TEMPLARS

The suppression of this great and powerful Order forms one of the darkest blots upon the tenebrous history of the Roman Catholic Church. The reports of the French trial were published by Michelet, the great historian, in 1851-61 and an excellent digest of the evidence given both in France and England is contained in a series of articles which appeared in 1907 in Ars Quattuor Coronatorum (xx, 47, 112, 269). We can give here but a brief outline of what took place, referring those who wish for a more detailed account to the sources quoted, and to the general literature of the subject.

Philip the Fair, King of France, was in desperate need of money. He had already debased the coinage, had arrested the Lombard bankers and the Jews, and after confiscating their wealth upon a trumped-up charge of usury - a thing abhorrent to the mediaeval mind - had expelled them from his country. Then he determined to get rid of the Templars, who had lent him large sums, and since the Pope, Clement V, owed his position to the intrigues of Philip, the matter presented little difficulty. His task was rendered easier, too, by the accusations brought against the Order by the ex-knight Esquiu de Floyran, who had a personal interest in the matter, and pretended to reveal all manner of evil things - blasphemy, immorality, idolatry and the worship of the devil under the form of a black cat. This traitor is still execrated in some of the Masonic rituals, together with one Noffo Dei of Florence, who, however had nothing to do with the matter.

These charges were accepted by Philip with delight, and on Friday, October 13th, 1307, all the Templars throughout France were arrested without warning on behalf of the most infamous tribunal that has ever existed, a collection of demons in human form called in ghastly mockery the Holy Office of the Inquisition, which at this time held plenary jurisdiction in this and other countries of Europe. The Templars were horribly tortured, so that many died, and the remainder confessed in set terms whatever the Church required. The interrogations were concerned chiefly with the alleged denial of Christ and the spitting on the cross, and in a minor degree with certain grave charges of immorality. A study of the evidence reveals the entire innocence of the Templars and the diabolical ingenuity of the familiars of the Holy Office, who kept them separated without adequate defence or proper  consultation, and circulated among them lying rumours that the Grand Master had confessed to the Pope that there were evils in the Order. The brethren were cajoled, bribed and tortured into confessing crimes they had never committed, and they were treated with the most fiendish cruelty.

Such was the “justice” of those who bore the name of the Lord of Love in the Middle Ages; such the compassion which was shown to His faithful servants, whose only crime was their wealth, lawfully won for the Order, and not for themselves. Philip the Fair obtained his money; but what karma, even in a thousand lives of suffering, could ever be sufficient for so vile a wretch? The Roman Church has doubtless many good deeds to its credit; but can all of them put together ever cancel such incredible wickedness as this?

The Pope desired to destroy the Order, and called a Council at Vienne in 1311 for that purpose, but the Bishops refused to condemn it unheard. The Pope, therefore, abolished the Order in private Consistory on November 22nd, 1312 (5312 A.L. - a date still commemorated in a striking fashion in our high-grade rituals), although he admitted that the charges were not proved. The riches of the Temple were to be transferred to the Order of S. John: but it is certain that the French portion found its way into the coffers of King Philip.

The last and most brutal act of this stupendous tragedy occurred on the 14th of March, 1314, when the venerable Grand Master of the Temple, Jacques de Molay, and Gaufrid de Charney, Preceptor of Normandy, were publicly burned as relapsed heretics before the great cathedral of Notre Dame. As the flames closed round him the Grand Master summoned the King and the Pope to meet him within a year before the judgment-seat of God, and both Pope and King were dead within twelve months.

THE PRESERVATION OF THE TEMPLARS’ TRADITION

The destruction of the Order of the Temple did not, however, involve a complete suppression of the teaching enshrined within it. Certain of the French Knights Templars took refuge with their brethren of the Temple in Scotland, and in that country their traditions became mingled to some extent with the ancient Celtic rites of Heredom, thus forming one of the sources from which the Scottish Rite was later to be evolved. Traditions of vengeance upon the execrable King and Pope and the Traitor passed down throughout the ages, and were interwoven with the Egyptian tradition corresponding to our Black Masonry, culminating in what we now call the 30°.

It is not difficult to see how such confusion might arise, especially among those who did not fully understand the inner meaning of the Egyptian teaching, and how a particular and temporary idea of vengeance might be blended with the philosophical doctrine of the meaning of evil and retribution and its place in the divine plan. It is these traditions of vengeance, however little understood, that form the basis of our 30° ritual, although in modern days the tendency has been to soften the harsh outlines as far as possible, to expunge all ideas of physical revenge, and even, as in the French rites, to delete all reference to the Templars and their wrongs.

Other streams said to be from the Order of the Temple are claimed as genuine by their modern representatives, but without sufficient reason. The French Ordre du Temple alleged a direct succession from Jacques de Molay, and produced in support thereof the celebrated Charter of Larmenius (which is usually considered a forgery); in any case the Ordre du Temple had no connection with modern Masonry. The Strict Observance, though it claimed to perpetuate Templar lines of thought, never, I believe, held its rituals to be of ancient origin, for these clearly belong to the eighteenth century. The modern Military and Religious Order of Knights Templars does not claim direct descent, though it may well embody certain genuine traditions. Its ritual is beautiful, and it appears to have been one of those rites which have been taken up by the H.O.A.T.F. and used. The real rites of the Templars have not survived, though it would no doubt be possible to reconstruct them, and certain traditions about them have passed down and become incorporated into various modern degrees.

THE ROYAL ORDER OF SCOTLAND

The most important of the bodies inheriting part of the Templar tradition is the Royal Order of Scotland, though it is in reality the result of the interaction of several lines of Masonic descent. As I have said on page 124, the doctrines which the Knights Templars brought with them from France when their Order was suppressed in their native country were intermingled with those of more than one of the existing Scottish rites. Those who founded it, or at least developed its teaching, appear to have been thoroughly eclectic, for in addition to the two  sources above indicated they seem to have assimilated a certain amount of material from the Culdees, and also from the Jewish tradition, though using the symbology of the Second Temple. Ramsay quotes in connection with it the Jewish legend of the sword and trowel; and it is with the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other that the Brn. of the Royal Order still take their O. I have already referred to its curious old rhymed ritual, which bears internal evidence of antiquity, and teaches the search for a lost word which is eventually found in Christ.

The Order consists of two degrees, the first that of HRDM or Heredom, and the second of RSYCRS or the Rosy Cross. The degree of HRDM is divided into two parts, the Passage of the Bridge, and the Admission to the Cabinet of Wisdom. It has certain resemblances to some of the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Its form has been very grossly corrupted to make it agree with the most extravagant form of modern protestantism, with references to the blood of Jesus, to the lamb and the book, etc. The quest for the Word is analagous to that undertaken in the Rose-Croix, though the degrees are quite different. Our 18° has little to do with the symbolism of the Royal Order, although the purpose of the two rites is the same. The 46° of the Rite of Mizraim (Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix of Kilwinning and of Heredom) has a close resemblance to the ritual of the Royal Order, bearing some of the signs and much of the essential meaning. Of all those bodies which may be thought of as developing into what afterwards became higher degrees, this Royal Order of Scotland was the first to formulate itself definitely, though little is heard of it in the outer world; and it may be taken as the primary type of the Scots degrees.

THE BROTHERS OF THE ROSY CROSS

The mysterious Order of the Rosy Cross still remains something of a problem to the student. The glamour of the Rosicrucian Philosophy has not yet passed away, and an enormous mass of controversial literature has gathered about the Order, many students affirming that it never existed at all, and that its famous manifestos were but an elaborate hoax played upon Europe by a few unscrupulous jesters; others say that the Society did exist, but that it was no more than an obscure Lutheran sect which thus cleverly advertised its opinions; others, again, think that it was a genuine school of wisdom, in which the deeper knowledge of life’s secrets was given to the few who were prepared by long discipline to receive it.

THE LITERATURE OF ROSICRUCIANISM

The Order of the Rosy Cross was first made known to Europe by the publication in 1614 of the Fama Fraternitatis of the Meritorious Order of the Rosy Cross, addressed to the Learned in General and the Govenors of Europe. This was, according to mediaeval custom, bound up with another treatise: A Universal Reformation of the Whole Wide World, by order of the God Apollo, is published by the Seven Sages of Greece, and some other Litterati. Some have thought this latter to be a Rosicrucian pamphlet, but in reality it is a translation from the Ragguagli di Parnasso of Boccalini, and probably, as Michael Maier held, had no connection with the Order at all.* (^A. E. Waite. The Real History of the Rosicrucians, p. 35.)

The Fama Fraternitatis contains a description of the traditional life of Christian Rosenkreutz (b. A.D. 1378), the founding of the Order of the Rosy Cross, and his death and burial. This is followed by a highly symbolical account of the discovery of the Tomb of C .: R .: C .: by Brn. “of the third order and row of succession”; and finally the resolution of the Head of the Order that it should now be proclaimed to the Western world is narrated, and an invitation issued (in five languages) to the learned of Europe to join the Fraternity. It closes with the statement that:

Although at this time we make no mention either of our names or meetings, yet nevertheless everyone’s opinion shall assuredly come to our hands, in what language so ever it be, nor any body shall fail, whoso gives but his name, to speak with some of us, either by word of mouth, or else, if there be some left, in writing.* (^Fama Fraternitatis, quoted op. cit., p. 83.)

This extraordinary document was followed in 1615 by another striking pamphlet, the Confessio Fraternitas R. C. ad Eruditos Europae, which was bound up in a Latin work entitled: Secretioris Philosophiae Consideratio Brevio a Philippo a Gabella, Philosophiae studioso, conscripta. In the Confessio, which is divided into fourteen chapters, we have a guarded account of the aims of the Society, the knowledge of nature’s secrets contained within its different grades, the dawn of a new age of regeneration, and a consequent appeal to all those who had the welfare of mankind at heart, and who cared nothing for the folly and selfishness of the “ungodly and accursed goldmaking” mentioned in the Fama, to join the Order and partake of its privileges:

We affirm that we have by no means made common property of our arcana, albeit they resound in five languages within the ears of the vulgar, both because, as we well know, they will not move gross wits, and because the worth of those who shall be accepted into our Fraternity will not be measured by their curiosity, but by the rule and pattern of our revelations. A thousand times the unworthy may clamour, a thousand times may present themselves, yet God hath commanded our ears that they should hear none of them, and hath so compassed us about with His clouds that unto us, His servants, no violence can be done; wherefore now no longer are we beheld by human eyes, unless they have received strength borrowed from the eagle.* (^Confessio Fraternitatis, quoted op. cit., p. 90.)

The Confessio is clearly written by one deeply versed in genuine occult lore, and contains a veiled but unmistakable promise that real knowledge will be given to the earnest and unselfish aspirant.

A year later a third pamphlet was published at Strasburg called The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutz, supposed to have existed in MSS. as early as 1601-2. It is dated Anno 1459, and commences with the following significant warning:

Arcana publicata vilescunt, et gratiam prophanata amittunt. Ergo: ne margaritas objice porcis, seu asino substernere rosas.* (^ “Published secrets become valueless, and things profaned lose their grace. Therefore cast not pearls before swine, nor strew roses before an ass.” Op. cit., p. 99.)

-       showing clearly that it was meant to be taken in a mystical sense. It is a long and cryptic account, lit with gleams of humour, of the initiation of Christian Rosenkreutz into the Mysteries of the Rosy Cross, commencing from his invitation, or awakening to the inner life, and ending with his final triumph or regeneration as a Knight of the Golden Stone. This is the most curious of all the Rosicrucian documents, and it will repay the close study necessary to its comprehension; for within it are contained some of the deepest secrets of spiritual alchemy.

The authorship of these pamphlets has always been a matter of speculation. They have all been attributed to Johann Valentine Andreas, a cultured and travelled German scholar of the seventeenth century, who was much interested in secret societies, and was a follower of the doctrines of Paracelsus. The arguments for and against his authorship are very ably given by Bro. A. E. Waite in his Real History of the Rosicrucians, and in his recent work, The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, in which, however he may mistake, in our opinion, as to the real purpose and aims of the original Order (the existence of which he denies) he has nevertheless brought together a mass of valuable facts which throw a good deal of light upon the whole question. Andreas acknowledges the Chymical Marriage, although he calls it a ludibrium or jest; from his later works he seems to have turned against the Order of the Rosy Cross, and started a new Society of his own. It is extremely unlikely, however, that Andreas was the author of the Fama and the Confessio.

These three documents raised an indescribable storm of curiosity all over Europe. Numbers of students wrote open letters applying to be admitted into the Order, and setting forth their qualifications; but none of these seem to have been openly answered. A multitude of pamphlets appeared, especially in Germany, some attacking the Society, and others no less valiantly defending it; while many charlatans arose, claiming to be Brethren of the R.C., and relieving the credulous of their superfluous money. The most noted of the opponents of Rosicrucianism was Andreas Libavius of Halle, who wrote three treatises against the Order, in the last of which, “though posing as a critic, he advises all persons to join the Order, because there is much to be learned and much wisdom to be gained by so doing.”.* (^The Real History of the Rosicrucians, p. 252.)

On the Rosicrucian side we may note the Echo of the God-illuminated  Brotherhood of the Venerable Order R.C., published in 1615, and supposed to have been written by Julius Sperber of Anholt, in which he asserts that the Rosicrucians possessed deep wisdom, although only a few had been accounted worthy to partake of it. The Echo claimed to embody absolute proof that the statements of Fama and Confessio were possible and true, that the facts had been commonly familiar to certain God-fearing people for more than nineteen years, and that they were on record in secret writings.* (^The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, p. 254.) Another pamphlet published in 1617, the Fraternitatis Rosatae Crucis Confessio Recepta, declares that it requires much study and careful research, as well as personal  sacrifice, to become the possessor of transcendental secrets.* (^The Real History of the Rosicrucians, p. 256.)

But the literature of the Rosy Cross was by no means confined to pamphlets. A system of philosophy was put before Europe through their mediation, a philosophy which bears a striking resemblance to that of the theurgic Neoplatonism of the third and fourth centuries of our era. Many great names are associated with the Order; among them was Michael Maier, who died in 1622, after writing the Silentium post Clamores (1617); the Symbola Aureae Mensae (1617), and the Themis Aurea (1618) - all of which expound and defend Rosicrucian and alchemical philosophy. Thomas Vaughan, although not an actual member of the Society, was in close sympathy with its tenets, and translated into English the Fama Fraternitatis and the Confessio. There were Robert Flood, a great English Rosicrucian philosopher, author of the Tractatus Apologeticus, the Tractatus Theologo-Philosophicus, and other works; “Sincerus Renatus,” or Sigmund Richter, who published in 1710 the curious work, The Perfect and True Preparation of the Philosophical Stone, according to the secret of the Brotherhoods of the Golden and Rosy Cross, with which is included the Rules of the above-mentioned Order for the initiation of new Members; and, lastly, the author of the Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, a rare book containing a number of occult engravings which enshrine much inner teaching.

THE TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF THE ROSICRUCIANS

The traditional history of Christian Rosenkreutz is contained in the Fama Fraternitatis, but it obviously cannot be accepted literally as it stands. It is clearly intended to bear an allegorical and mystical meaning, like all the traditional histories in the mystic schools; and, although certain historical facts may well be woven into its structure, they can only be subordinate to the living truth its author has sought to convey. Origen clearly states the principle always used in the Mysteries in his De Principiis:

Where the Word found that things done according to the history could be adapted to these mystical senses, he made use of them, concealing from the multitude the deeper meaning; but where, in the narrative of the development of supersensual things, there did not follow the performance of those certain events which were already indicated by the mystical meaning, the Scripture interwove in the history the account of some event that did not take place,  sometimes what could not have happened; sometimes what could, but did not.* (^Origen, Bk. IV, Chap. i, 15 (Ante-Nicene Library Ed.)

This is one of the methods by which the secret teachings are guarded from the profane, who throw them aside, thinking that as history they are inaccurate and uninteresting, and so completely miss their deeper meaning.

The Fama Fraternitatis, which admittedly contains only a tradition, written down long after the events recorded had taken place, tells us how C .: R .: C .: was born in A.D. 1378, of poor but noble parents, and how he entered a monastery at a very early period of his life. While still quite young, he is said to have journeyed to Cyprus with a Brother P.A.L., who died there. He then crossed to Palestine, and came into touch at the age of sixteen with the wise men of Damcar in Arabia,

Who received him not as a stranger (as he himself witnesseth), but as one whom they had long expected; they called him by his name, and shewed him other secrets out of his cloyster, whereat he could not but mightily wonder.* (^Fama Fraternitatis, quoted in The Real History, etc., p. 67, from which translation the citations following are also taken.)

There he learnt Arabic, translated into Latin the book M., which he afterwards brought to Europe, and in which Paracelsus was said to have been interested; and thence he travelled to Egypt and to Fez, to become acquainted with the “Elementary Inhabitants, who revealed unto him many of their secrets”.

From Fez the Founder of the Order is said to have crossed into Spain, where he offered his knowledge to the learned, but “to them it was a laughing matter”. He therefore returned to Germany, his own native country, determining gradually to begin there the foundation of the brotherhood that was destined to reform Europe. He chose three brethren out of his own monastery to be the first Rosicrucians; and later increased the number to eight, binding them by certain definite rules.

The brethren then went forth to the world, leaving only two of their number to remain with the head of the Order. In due time, Christian Rosenkreutz died, and was buried very secretly in the tomb prepared for him, his resting-place remaining unknown even to members of the  fraternity.

At a later period, a seeming accident revealed the door of the tomb, upon which was written in great letters: “Post cxx Annos Patebo” - After a hundred and twenty years I will come forth.” In the midst of the tomb there shone a blazing star, and upon the altar in the centre of the vault these significant words were engraved: “A.C.R.C. Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulchrum feci” - “I have made this my tomb a compendium of the universe.” Beneath the altar was found “a fair and worthy body … with all the ornaments and attires. In his hand he held the parchment called T., the which next unto the Bible is our greatest treasure, which ought not to be delivered to the censure of the world.” Various other objects were discovered - “looking-glasses of divers virtues, little bells, burning lamps, and chiefly wonderful artificial songs” - and most important of all, the secret Book M. and other volumes, including certain of those of Paracelsus, the philosopher and chemist of the sixteenth century.

Such is the traditional history of Christian Rosenkreutz, as contained in the documents of the Order. The form in which the story is cast shows that it is obviously not intended to be an historical narrative. It is clearly designed as an allegory to express certain hidden truths to those whose eyes are opened, even though historical details are probably contained within it.

THE HISTORY OF THE ORDER

Despite the assertions of scholars and the absence of corroborative evidence, Christian Rosenkreutz did indeed found the Order of the Rosy Cross, and he was in fact an incarnation of that mighty Master of the Wisdom whom we revere to-day as the H.O.A.T.F. He was born in 1375, three years before the date given in the Fama, and was sent, when quite young, to a lonely monastery on the borders of Germany and Austria, where he received his education and training. Like many such communities in the Middle Ages, this monastery preserved a secret tradition, and its monks, who devoted themselves to meditation, were possessed of genuine spiritual and occult knowledge. Here Christian Rosenkreutz studied those deeper secrets of nature of which chemistry is but the outer shell, that alchemy which is concerned primarily with the transformation of the lead of the personality into the gold of the spirit, and only secondarily with the transmutation of metals and the manufacture of jewels. Christian Rosenkreutz now began to travel, and after passing through Germany, Austria and Italy, finally reached Egypt, where he was welcomed by the Brethren of the Egyptian Lodge of that White Brotherhood to which in past lives he had belonged.

In Egypt Christian Rosenkreutz was received into all the degrees of the Egyptian Mysteries, which had been preserved by the White Lodge in direct succession from the hierophants of old; and through him we may trace one of the most important of the lines of succession which eventually became incorporated into the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Among other things he adapted, and translated into Latin from the Egyptian, that Ritual of the Rosy Cross to which we have already referred, and this became the prototype of the Ceremony of Perfection worked in the Sovereign Chapters of Co-Masonry to-day.

On his return from Egypt Christian Rosenkreutz founded the Order of the Rosy Cross, choosing here and there a brother who was worthy to be brought into touch with the secret Mysteries of Egypt and the profound occult knowledge which they enshrined. The Order was always extremely limited in numbers, some thirty or forty at most, but it had an enormous effect upon the secret tradition in Europe, and indeed formed a Western school through which the White Lodge might be directly reached. In later days a portion of its teaching and ritual  passed into less exclusive hands, and it is through one of these semi-exoteric bodies that the Rose-Croix Ritual was transmitted into the keeping of the Council of Emperors of the East and West.* (^See chapter xi.)

During its passage through many hands ignorant of its true meaning that Ritual has suffered much distortion, being on the one hand blended with protestant Christianity, as in English and American workings, or rationalized beyond recognition under the auspices of the  Supreme Council of France. In our Co-Masonic Order we have the great privilege of using, by order of the H.O.A.T.F., an English translation of His original Latin ceremonial and I think that we may say without exaggeration that it is one of the most stately and beautiful  rituals of the Rose-Croix in existence.

The Rose-Croix, as we have said before, is essentially a degree of Christhood, concerned with the awakening of the Christ mystical within the heart, the hidden Love which is the heart of the mystic rose, and which can only be known when the heart is laid upon the Cross of  Sacrifice; but it was not originally intended to be an appendage to Christianity, as it has now become in England, but rather an independent sacramental channel through which the Lord of Love may pour down His Blessing upon initiates of every faith, for it was founded thousands of years before the birth of the disciple Jesus in Palestine. Thus although it is the Christ, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, who is adored in the Rose-Croix, the Christ whose Love is outpoured  in the Sovereign Chapters of Heredom, in our Co-Masonic Ritual we  speak of Him only as the Lord of Love, and do not bind our Brn. especially to the doctrines of the last great faith which He founded in person on earth; for He is the Lord of all religions alike, and the  Rose-Croix is no less His than the glorious sacraments of the Christian  Church which He Himself gave two thousand years ago.

The original Order of the Rosy Cross still exists in utter secrecy, and, although it is unknown in the outer world, its Mysteries are yet handed down on the physical plane, and it still preserves the ancient secrets of healing and magic which its M.W.S. brought in the fifteenth century from the Egyptian Lodge. Only very few, and those high Initiates of the White Lodge from whence it came, are admitted to its House of the Holy Spirit. Many have claimed and still claim to belong to it, but it is quite independent of the many Orders and Societies, both open and secret, which bear its hallowed name in the twentieth century. In Masonry, however, we inherit some portion of its ritual, though but little of its hidden lore, and the sacramental powers of the Rosy Cross yet shine through certain of our high grades in the

Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. There is thus good reason why modern Masons have claimed affinity with the Rosy Cross, and why it has exercised so fascinating an influence over the minds of men since it was first heard of in the seventeenth century.

It is the nearest approach to “a higher degree” that existed in ancient Egypt; in fact, we may say that to all intents and purposes it was a higher degree, though it never called itself so. I have explained in The Hidden Life in Freemasonry that in Egypt thousands of years ago there were three Grand Lodges which differed from all the rest in their objects and workings, and that it was these three Lodges which, at certain stated times every year, undertook the duty of flooding the land with spiritual force by means of the magnificent ritual of The Building of the Temple of Amen.* (^The Hidden Life in Freemasonry, p. 290.) When the Brn. were performing that holy duty they showed their solidarity with ordinary Masonry by opening in the 1° and raising the Lodge as quickly as possible to the 3° before commencing their wonderful work; on the comparatively rare occasions when they had to admit a candidate carefully selected from one of the Craft Lodges, they did not open in Blue Masonry at all, but plunged straight into this ceremony of the Rose-Croix.

The ritual had to be modified somewhat in the eighteenth century to bring it into harmony with the system of higher degrees which it had then been thought well to adopt; the list and explanation of those degrees were added, and also the reference to Jerusalem. The Word, which in modern Masonry has degenerated into mere initials, was then in itself a living “word of power,” pregnant with deepest meaning, though a double scheme of initials was also used. All this needed and received the most skilful attention when the translation from Egyptian into Latin was made; one cannot but admire the marvellous ingenuity which, while changing the language, yet contrived to keep practically intact the sound, the form, and an elaborate triple set of meanings, one within the other. The eighteenth century additions have considerably lengthened the ceremony, but they are congruous with the older part, so that it still retains its transcendent beauty; and all the principal features of the degree - the rose, the cross, the cup, the sacrament - are precisely the same as they were thousands of years ago.

2      THE SCOTTISH RITE

ORIGIN OF THE RITE

THE origin of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of 33°, or rather that of the Rite of Perfection or of Heredom of 25° out of which it was evolved, has been one of the most obscure Masonic problems; practically nothing is known about it by scholars, since no authentic contemporary evidence is preserved in available documents or publications. This silence need cause but little wonder to the student who has followed us so far, for, like many other activities both in politics and religion, the high-grade Masonry of the early eighteenth century was intended to be kept secret, and the secrecy was preserved by committing nothing to writing and leaving no trace on the physical plane. I cannot expect that my statements will be accepted by Masonic scholars who pin their faith to documents alone, but I shall nevertheless give a brief account of what actually took place, supplying corroborative evidence whenever possible from reliable historians, so far as their works are available to me. This book is written in Australia, far away from the chief centres of Masonic life and learning, and I have consequently had to depend largely upon the resources of my own library. If I had access to a larger selection of Masonic volumes I should no doubt be able to find other fragments of valuable testimony.

THE JACOBITE MOVEMENT

There has been a persistent tradition among Continental writers upon Masonry that the Jacobites had much to do with the development of the higher degrees of the eighteenth century; and, as Bro. R. R. Gould points out, colour is lent to this view by the fact that the earliest names mentioned in connection with Freemasonry in France are those of well-known adherents of the Stuarts, although he himself rejects the hypothesis for lack of sufficient evidence.* (^Gould. Hist. Freem., III, 78.) We have the direct and personal testimony of Baron von Hund, the founder of the Rite of the Strict Observance, given in 1764, that he himself was received into the Order of the Temple in Paris in 1743 by “an unknown Bro., the Knight of the Red Feather, in the presence of Lord Kilmarnock* (^At that time Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and Master of Lodge Kilwinning on his election to that high office in 1742. Ibid., p. 53.) … and that he was subsequently introduced as a distinguished Brother of the Order to Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender”.* (^Ibid., p. 101.) From papers found after his death it is clear that von Hund regarded the Knight of the Red Feather as Prince Charles himself. The life of von Hund shows him to have been a man of stainless honour who had made great sacrifices for the cause which he had at heart; and although it has been said that in 1777 Prince Charles denied to an emissary of the Strict Observance* (^Ibid., p. 110.) that he had ever been a Freemason, such an official démenti is not unknown even to-day in political circles, and perhaps we need not attach great importance to it.

The Scottish adherents of King James II, who followed him into exile after the landing of the Prince of Orange in 1688, brought to the English Court at S. Germains (which had been placed at the disposal of the King by Louis XIV) those ancient rites of Heredom and Kilwinning, intermingled with the Templar tradition, to which we have already referred. When King James II fled from England he took refuge at the Jesuit Abbey of Clermont, which had attached to it a College of Clermont in Paris, founded by Guillaume du Prat, Bishop of Clermont, in 1550.* (^The Catholic Encyclopaedia (1913), Vol. xiv, p. 88.) There, most unexpectedly, the King found a Masonic centre, working rites which had been handed down in France from a remote past. An intermingling of two traditions thus took place, and it was at this period - many years before the revival in 1717 - that certain of the ceremonies which are to-day included in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite were first put together.

It is probably this fact which gave birth to that other recurring tradition that the Jesuits were connected with the development of high-grade Masonry on the Continent; and it is from this indigenous French tradition, of which another branch had found its way into the Compagnonnage, that the rituals of French Craft Masonry - so different from the English - were derived. A further intermingling with the English tradition transmitted through Anderson no doubt took place after 1717.

King James conceived the idea of trying to use Freemasonry to assist him in his endeavour to regain his throne; but this attempt failed, for, though they sympathized with the King, the Masonic authorities staunchly refused to abandon their traditional neutral policy, or to allow the Order to become a cloak for political intrigue. The Jacobite influence nevertheless left its traces upon this part of Masonry, and in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite the 14° is still called, under some Obediences, Grand Scottish Knight of the Sacred Vault of James VI, though its older name was Grand, Elect, Ancient Perfect Master.* (^A. E. Waite. Secret Tradition in Freemasonry, Vol. I, p. 125.) Baron von Hund spoke the truth when he claimed to have met Prince Charles in Paris in 1743, and he seems to have inherited certain lines of succession which afterwards became the heart of the Rite of the Strict Observance. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which practically destroyed the Jacobite movement, the connection of the Stuarts with Masonry was dropped, and it seems probable that Baron von Hund himself composed the Latin Rituals of the Strict Observance, which played a considerable part in German Masonry in the eighteenth century.* (^Gould. Hist. Freem., III, 101.)

THE ORATION OF RAMSAY

After the year 1740 “Scots Degrees” sprang up in all parts of France,* (^Ibid., p. 92.) and their creation and development are largely attributable to the celebrated Oration delivered in 1737 in the Provincial Grand Lodge of England in Paris by the Chevalier Ramsay; although the first published reference to a “Scotch Masons’ Lodge” occurs as early as 1733 in London.* (^R. F. Gould, A.Q.C., XVI, 44.)

Ramsay was born in 1681 or 1682 at Ayr near Kilwinning (though he does not seem ever to have joined that ancient Lodge). He was converted to Catholicism by Archbishop Fenelon, whose Life he wrote and with whom he continued to live till his death in 1715. After that he acted as tutor to the two sons of the rightful King James III in Rome. He was unquestionably a learned man, a deep student both of ancient and modern history, a D.C.L. of Oxford University and, like many other prominent Freemasons of the period, a Fellow of the Royal Society. He never appears to have taken much interest in Masonry, though he wrote to Cardinal Fleury, the Prime Minister of France, in 1737 asking his protection for the Freemasons, and stating that their ideals were very high and most useful to religion, literature and the state. He died in 1743.

But although Ramsay never did much work for Masonry, the Oration which he delivered in 1737 before the Provincial Grand Lodge of England in Paris, of which he was Grand Chancellor and Orator, had a profound influence upon French Masonry. It was a tolerably good Oration, but nothing very extraordinary. None the less it appears to have given just that impetus that was needed to set the French high-grade movement in activity, and ever afterwards the makers of high grades looked to Ramsay as their pattern and ensample.

He proclaimed the ideal of Masonry to be a Universal Brotherhood of cultured men, a Spiritual Empire that would change the world. He refers to the three degrees, and calls them Novices or Apprentices, Fellows or Professed Brothers, Masters or Perfected Brothers - a slightly different set of titles which may refer to a different stream of tradition. These are required to practise respectively the moral virtues, the heroic virtues and the Christian virtues.

According to him, Masonry was founded in remote antiquity and was renewed or restored in the Holy Land at the time of the Crusades. It has affinities with the ancient Mysteries, especially those of Ceres at Eleusis, Isis in Egypt and others. The Crusaders adopted a set of “ancient signs and symbolical words drawn from the well of religion,” which were intended to distinguish Crusader from Saracen, and were concealed under strict pledges of secrecy. The intimate union between the Crusading Masons and the Knights of S. John of Jerusalem is the reason why the Blue degrees are called S. John’s Masonry. The returning Crusaders brought Lodges of Masonry to Europe, and from thence they were introduced into Scotland, where “James, Lord Steward of Scotland, was Grand Master of a Lodge established at Kilwinning, in the West of Scotland in 1286, shortly after the death of Alexander III, King of Scotland, and one year before John Baliol mounted the throne”.

Ramsay goes on to explain that by degrees our Lodges and rites were neglected almost everywhere, but nevertheless they were preserved in all their integrity amongst those Scotsmen to whom the kings of France confided during many centuries the safeguarding of their royal persons. He allows that “Great Britain became the seat of our Order, the conservator of our laws and the depository of our secrets”. Many of our rites and usages which were contrary to the prejudice of the reformers were changed, disguised or suppressed. Thus it was that many Brn. forgot the spirit and retained only the shell of the outer form. Masonry however is to be restored to its pristine glory in the future.

The rituals of these Scots Degrees are varied, but one chief idea underlies them all - the discovery in a vault by Scottish Crusaders of the long-lost and ineffable Word, during the search for which they had to work with the sword in one hand, and the trowel in other.* (^Hist. Freem., III, p. 92.) This same symbolism of the sword and the trowel is mentioned in Ramsay’s speech, in which he derives Freemasonry from the patriarchs and the ancient Mysteries through the Scottish crusaders; and they are further mentioned both in the present ritual of the Royal Order of Scotland, in which the candidate takes his O. with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other,* (^A. E. Waite. Secret Tradition in Freemasonry, Vol. I, p. 404.) and in a quotation from that ritual occurring as early as 1736 in print at Newcastle.* (^A. Q. C., XV, 186.) We hear of two Scottish degrees being received by Baron C. Scheffer, the first Grand Master of Sweden, in 1737,* (^Gould. Concise History, p. 300.) and we may perhaps suggest - though in opposition to the theory held by most Masonic writers - that the oration of Ramsay, although it may have helped to popularize Scottish Masonry, was in reality an effect rather than the cause of the introduction of high-grade Masonry on the Continent, which was all the time being quietly directed from behind by the H.O.A.T.F.

The Scots Masters claimed extraordinary privileges in the French Craft Lodges, and these were formally recognized by the Grand Lodge of France in 1755.* (^Gould. Hist. Freem., III, p. 95.) They wore distinctive clothing, remained covered in a Masters’ Lodge, claimed the right to confer the Craft degrees with or without a ceremony; and eventually the Scots Lodge actually appointed the W.M. of the corresponding Craft Lodge without consulting the Brn. over whom he was to rule. They further usurped the privilege of the Grand Lodge and issued warrants of constitution. One of the most important of these is the Mere-Loge-Ecossaise of  Marseilles, said to have been constituted in 1751, which worked a number of degrees not belonging to what afterwards became the Scottish Rite, but later incorporated - at least as far as their titles are concerned - in the Rite of Memphis of 96°. These Scots Lodges or still more, the Royal Order of Scotland from which they arose, form the first public manifestation of the movement for creating high degrees which reached such a fervour of activity in the latter half of the eighteenth century.

THE CHAPTER OF CLERMONT

Our main channel of descent lies behind the Scots Lodges, and first appears indubitably in the outer world in the Chapter of Clermont, commonly thought to have been founded by the Chevalier de Bonneville in 1754,* (^Ibid., p. 94.) but in reality a continuation of that same Order of the Temple into which Baron von Hund was received in 1743, which was derived from the Scottish courtiers exiled at S. Germains and from the College of Clermont. According to Thory (who, however, wrote sixty years after the event) this Chapter was based on the three degrees of Blue Masonry, the Scots or S. Andrew’s Degree, and worked three higher grades - 5, Knight of the Eagle or Select Master; 6, Illustrious Knight or Templar; 7, Sublime Illustrious Knight.

In the later form in which it emerges in 1754 both Jacobite and Jesuit connections had been dropped, and the succession, together with certain ceremonial degrees, probably including a form of the Kadosh, had passed into the hands of distinguished French noblemen, courtiers,  military officers, and the elite of the professions.* (^Ibid., p. 95.) It was in this Chapter of Clermont and in the Council of the Emperors of the East and West into which it was transformed in 1758, that the colossal work of casting the ancient traditions into a ceremonial rite was to a great extent performed; and it is in these two bodies, which were yet one body, that the immediate origin of our Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is to be found.

THE COUNCIL OF EMPERORS

The Council of Emperors was composed largely of men of noble birth and high culture who were also deep students of the secret science, learned in various traditions of the wisdom which had been handed down along so many lines in the past. They had inherited not only the Clermont Rites and the Scottish lines of Kilwinning and of Heredom, but other traditions derived directly from both Templar and Rosicrucian sources, together with the powers of the Egyptian rite to which we have previously referred. They were men of wide knowledge, but also apparently of overweening pride, like so many of the nobles of the ancien regime; and the drawing together of this body of noblemen was one of the attempts made by the emissaries of the White Lodge to prepare them for the great changes which should have been accomplished, had not their pride been so great, without the horrors of the French Revolution.

A definite commission appears to have been given to them by the  H.O.A.T.F., the Master the Comte de S. Germain Himself, to mould all these various traditions, which He had caused them to inherit, into a rite which should express to some extent the power for good of the  Egyptian succession in a form suited to a more modern age. These orders they proceeded to carry out as faithfully as possible, and the result of their labours was the Rite of Perfection or of Heredom of twenty-five degrees, all of which are still contained in our modern Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

The Council of Emperors received much inspiration from the H.O.A.T.F., although not necessarily on the physical plane, and it must have been far easier to influence such a body of men than the frequentors of those Georgian taverns which were the first temples of the English Mysteries after the great revival in 1717. But, as with many other attempts to synthesize a number of traditions by a committee of revision, the Council of Emperors was hampered in its work by the necessity of including less important materials which had come into the hands of certain of its members. The result is seen in the inclusion of several almost meaningless intermediate degrees, which still belong to the Scottish Rite, but are seldom or never worked among US.

A certain marriage of traditions took place in the case of the 18°, for the great ritual of the Rosy Cross used for the perfecting of the Rosicrucian and Egyptian Brethren, though shorn already of much of its ancient splendour, was blended with the old Mithraic Eucharist handed down in the Rites of Heredom, to form the source of our modern workings of the Rose-Croix. The Emperors’ Ritual of the 30°, then called the 24°, Grand Commander of the Black and White Eagle, Grand Elect Kadosh, reflected far more efficiently the Egyptian  teachings of Black Masonry than those which have to-day reached us  through the hands of many editors, who were ignorant of their true meaning. The highest Degree among them was the 25°, now our 32°, called Most Illustrious Prince of Masonry, Grand and Sublime Knight  Commander of the Royal Secret; and the Tracing Board of the 32°, often little understood, reflects their original plan of union with the, Hidden Light through the passing of many rites of initiation.

There was no degree of Sovereign Grand Inspector-General, for the 33° as such did not yet exist; but the wonderful powers which now belong to that high rank were conferred upon their Grand Inspectors, chosen from among the Prince Masons of the 25°; and the great white Angels who wear the insignia of the KING were linked with these, even as they are linked with the Brn. of the 33° to-day. The crimson Angels of the Rosy Cross likewise attended their Sovereign Chapters, and many other glorious powers which are ours to-day were theirs also. Thus the Council of Emperors represents the first real attempt ever made to incorporate the full Egyptian inner tradition into a ceremonial form; and as such it is an important landmark in the history of Masonry.

Almost all the splendid teaching given by the great Master the Comte de St. Germain, by Pere Joseph and Cagliostro, and other emissaries of the White Lodge, was swept into oblivion in the colossal tragedy of the French Revolution. The Rite of Perfection of twenty-five degrees was carried into Great Britain, and handed down among the Templar Encampments long before the advent of the Supreme Councils of the Scottish Rite which derived their authority from Charleston. Most of the Brn. of the old Rite joined the new Obediences as soon as they  were formed; but there exists to-day one line of tradition at least, in part derived from those old Templar Encampments, which has never been incorporated in the Supreme Councils of England, Scotland and Ireland. There was also a perpetuation in France, which later amalgamated with the French Supreme Council.* (^Gould. Hist. Freem., p. 164.)

STEPHEN MORIN

The scene of our story now shifts to the New World; for it was there that the change from the Rite of Perfection of 25° into the Scottish Rite of 33° took place. In 1761, three years only after its foundation, the Council of the Emperors of the East and West granted a patent to one Stephen Morin “to establish perfect and sublime Masonry in all parts of the world,” constituting him a Grand Inspecter of the Rite of Perfection. The patent authorized him to “form and establish a Lodge in order to admit to and multiply the Royal Order of Masons in all the perfect and sublime degrees,” and gave him power to create other Inspectors. The original of this document has not yet been found, and the world knows of it only from the copy preserved in the Golden Book of the Comte de Grasse-Tilly, founder of the Supreme Council 33° of France. Bro. R. R Gould, however, has a right intuition in the matter, for he “is by no means prepared to deny its authenticity,” and a complete transcription of it is given in his History of Freemasonry.* (^III, p. 125ff.)  It is signed by Chaillon de Joinville, Prince de Rohan, Brest-de-laChaussee, Comte de Choiseul, and others of the Council of the  Emperors. In 1761, Stephen Morin arrived in San Domingo, where he commenced the dissemination of the rite, and appointed many Inspectors both for the West Indies and the United States.* (^Mackey’s Encyclopaedia. Art. Scottish Rite.)

He was unfortunately by no means an ideal Channel for spiritual force, and although he certainly transmitted to his American Brn. the Egyptian succession of powers, he was sometimes not in possession of the fullness of the power himself. At times he rose splendidly to the occasion, and showed signs of distinct advancement; I have watched him during the consecration of a Chapter of the high degrees magnificently overshadowed by the H.O.A.T.F. Himself and the great white Angels. But it cannot be denied that he had many faults, among others a passion for amorous intrigues; and not infrequently the greater part of his spiritual heritage was withdrawn, leaving him the mere seeds of the succession to transmit to others. The reports of his misdoings were so numerous and persistent that at one time the Council of Emperors actually withdrew his patent; but posts were slow in those days, and before the withdrawal reached him the Council had already cancelled it, and fully reinstated him.

Stephen Morin was also unfortunate in his choice of lieutenants, for in many cases these were Jews of not very good repute; and it is through these somewhat soiled hands that we must trace the Rite of Perfection during the next forty years. The rite passed through a period of obscuration, when the degrees were shamelessly sold to any who would buy their titles, and the inner meaning of the ceremonies was almost forgotten. But although the splendid occult knowledge of the Emperors was lost and the rites became shorn of most of their power, the seeds of the succession still passed down - until a higher class of egos was guided into the rite and a new era began. The rite was established at Charleston in 1783 by Isaac da Costa, who was created Deputy-Inspecter of South Carolina by Moses Hayes. It will be seen that a succession is definitely claimed by the authorities of the rite.

FREDERICK THE GREAT

It was during this period of obscuration that the curious myth of Frederick the Great arose among the Jews, probably in order to enhance the commercial value of the degrees; and it was apparently really believed that the King of Prussia was the Supreme Head of the Rite, for in the Minutes of the Grand Lodge of Perfection in Albany (New York), founded in 1767, the Lodge is required, on September 3rd, 1770, to prepare its report for transmission to Berlin. We find also in 1785, one year before the king’s death, a letter addressed to Frederick by a certain Solomon Bush, Deputy Grand Inspector of North America, asking for recognition of a Lodge which he had consecrated.* (^Note Historique sur le Rite Ecoss . : Anc . : et Acc . : Par le Souv .: Gr .: (Count  Goblet d’Alviella) p. 7.) It was afterwards alleged that Frederick the Great, on his death-bed, ratified the Grand Constitutions of 1786 containing the laws that still bind the Scottish Rite, and that he constituted the 33° in person, delegating his powers as a Sovereign of Masonry to nine Brn. in each country. The original Grand Constitutions were in French, but in 1834 a Latin version of them alleged to have been signed by Frederick himself was accepted as genuine by the Supreme Council of France; but this is now on all sides admitted to be a forgery.

The truth is that Frederick took no active part in the Rite of Perfection, that he neither ratified the Constitutions nor created the 33°; and indeed to-day the majority even of the Supreme Councils are prepared to waive the claim that they derive their authority from Frederick the Great, whose interest in Masonry (at any rate in later years) was but of the slightest. The grand constitutions nevertheless remain the law of the Rite in all Supreme Councils deriving lawfully from Charleston, and Albert Pike believed them to be genuine. As it is certain that Frederick had nothing to do with the Rite, I fear we must regretfully conclude that both the fourth and the fifth documents in de Grasse-Tilly’s Golden Book - the alleged Constitutions of 1762 and the Grand Constitutions of 1786 - were forgeries. It would seem that they were sent over from Europe, perhaps in response to a demand from the Jewish interest; and the fact that Dr. Dalcho’s father was an officer in the Prussian army who had served with great distinction under Frederick the Great may well have disposed the Doctor the more readily to accept these remarkable documents.

THE CHARLESTON TRANSFORMATION

The second great transformation of the high degrees, though it was on a far smaller scale than the first, took place at Charleston before 1801. We learn from the Circular of Dr. Dalcho that

On the 31st of May, 1801, the Supreme Council of the Thirty-Third Degree for the United States of America was opened, with the high honours of Masonry, by Brothers John Mitchell and Frederick Dalcho, Sovereign Grand Inspectors-General; and in the course of the present year (1802) the whole number of Grand Inspectors-General was completed, agreeably to the Grand Constitutions.* (^Quoted in Mackey’s Encyclopaedia. Art. Supreme Council.)

Such is a brief account of the formation of that which called itself the Mother Supreme Council of the World, from which, indeed, all other Supreme Councils of the world spring, with the exception of a few survivals of other lines of descent. It is clear from archives in the possession of the Mother Supreme Council that up to the eve of its formation the only degrees worked were the 25° of the Rite of Perfection.

The formation of the new Rite was inspired and directed by the H.O.A.T.F. Himself, and the extra eight degrees which then appeared were but rearrangements of the old twenty-five degrees of the Rite of Perfection. Now that more advanced egos had come into possession of the degrees, a fuller manifestation of the power behind was permitted; and since then the Scottish Rite, though its rituals have been altered in various countries and in various interests, has become the most important and splendid of all Masonic Obediences.

THE SPREAD OF THE SCOTTISH RITE

We may here refer back to the third document in the Golden Book, the patent granted to De Grasse-Tilly by the new Supreme Council 33° in Charleston in 1802, only a few months after its formation, which certifies that he has been tested in all the degrees of the Rite and authorizes him to erect Lodges, Chapters, Councils and Consistories in both hemispheres, creating him Sovereign Grand Commander of a Supreme Council for the Antilles for life. It is signed by Dalcho, De la Hogue and others, who all describe themselves as Kadosh, Prince of the Royal Secret, Sov. Gr. Inspector 33°.

The Scottish Rite was introduced by the Comte de Grasse-Tilly into France (1804); from France it passed into Italy (1805), Spain (1811) and Belgium (1817). In 1824 the Supreme Council for Ireland was formed with jurisdiction over the official degrees of White Masonry only, because of the previous existence of Chapters and Lodges of Rose-Croix and Kadosh belonging to the old Rite of Perfection. The Supreme Council of England and Wales was formed in 1845, and that of Scotland a year later.

In America in 1812 a working jeweller named Joseph Cerneau established in Boston what he called a Sovereign Grand Consistory of the United States. Cerneau possessed the necessary succession, and so was able to pass on the actual powers; but as he had no mandate from the Council of Emperors the Charleston Supreme Council denounced his proceedings as irregular, and themselves appointed a Supreme Council for the Northern Jurisdiction a year later. Supreme Councils deriving from Cerneau still exist, though they are not recognized by bodies holding the Charleston succession. Both lines, however, are valid.

The rite has spread into almost all countries of the world, and does an incalculable amount of good to thousands upon thousands of Brn., even though but few derive from it the full possibilities of spiritual advancement which lie behind it. But to be brought, however unconsciously, into touch with so holy an influence must unquestionably uplift and bless even the least sensitive; and some touch of its hidden glory is conferred upon all.

2      THE CO-MASONIC ORDER

THE RESTORATION OF AN ANCIENT LANDMARK

THE Co-Masonic Order is distinguished from the rest of the Masonic world by the admission of women to Masonry on equal terms with men. In this it is introducing no innovation into the body of Masonry, but rather restoring one of the ancient landmarks which was forgotten during the confusion of the Mysteries with the operative Masonry of the Middle Ages. In both Egypt and Greece, as we have seen, women were admitted to the Mysteries, and were able to penetrate into the inmost sanctuaries as well as men. The officials of the masculine Craft are for the most part against their admission to-day. They have been most strongly impressed, and quite rightly so, with the paramount importance of keeping the rituals and customs unchanged; but they quite wrongly regard the admission of women as a serious departure from ancient usage. Co-Masons are equally urgent in their respect for the traditions; but in this matter they prefer to follow the older custom, which has also the added merit of being logical and fair. Since reincarnation is a fact, there is no difference between the ego or soul of a man and that of a woman; and we do not see any reason why in a particular birth, because he happens in the course of his evolution to occupy a woman’s body, that ego should be deprived of the advantages of initiation into the sacred Mysteries of Masonry.

THE SUCCESSION OF CO-MASONRY

The Co-Masonic Order derives its succession of Sovereign Grand Inspectors-General of the 33° from certain Brn. belonging to the Supreme Council of France, founded by the Comte de Grasse-Tilly in 1804. In his booklet, Universal Co-Freemasonry: What is it?, the Very Illustrious Bro. J. I. Wedgwood, 33° gives the following account of its foundation, which he derives from the official minutes of the Supreme Council published in Dr. Georges Martin’s Etude de la Franc-Maconnerie Mixte et de son Organisation, and from Transaction No.1 of the Dharma Lodge, Benares:

Our own Order of Universal Co-Freemasonry, or, to give it its French title, L’Ordre Maconnique Mixte Internationale, is the first Masonic body which has aimed at establishing a world-wide order to which women should be admitted on equal terms with men. Its career began in the year 1882. There existed a body styling itself La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France. It consisted of various Craft Lodges which had broken loose from the Supreme Council in France and constituted themselves into a Grand Lodge. It was only anticipating what the other Craft Lodges under the Supreme Council did in 1894-97, when they organized themselves into the now existing Grand Lodge of France, and absorbed into themselves, with one exception, the Lodges of La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France. This latter body, with which we are concerned, almost at once received recognition from the Grand Orient of France …

The principle which this particular schism espoused was that of the autonomy of Craft Lodges, summed up in the phrase Le Macon libre dans la Loge libre - a principle sound enough in the main, but, it may at once be confessed, obviously not capable of application outside certain wide limits. Still, it has always received much recognition in France, ever since French Masonry broke away from the parent English stem. One of the Lodges holding from this body was called Les Libres Penseurs, and met at Pecq, a little place in the Department of Seine et Oise. This Lodge - belonging to a then recognized Masonic Obedience - decided to initiate a woman, a certain Mdlle. Maria Deraismes, a well-known authoress and lecturer, noted for her service to humanitarian and feminist movements. They did so, in the presence of a large assembly, on January 14th, 1882. The Right Worshipful Master, Bro. Houbron, 18°,  justified their experiment as having the welfare and highest interests of humanity at heart, and as being a perfectly logical application of the principle of ‘A Free Mason in a Free Lodge’. The Lodge was of course suspended for putting the family motto into practice …

For some time Sister Maria Deraismes did nothing in the way of extending to others the Masonic privileges she had received. Eventually she yielded to the persuasions of friends, and notably of Dr. Georges Martin. This latter gentleman was a member of the Lodge Les Libres Penseurs when Mdlle. Deraismes was initiated. He gave her his staunch support and the benefit of his wide Masonic experience throughout her Masonic career. Upon his retirement from political life - he had been a Senator - he devoted his energies to the helping of humanity through our Order … On March 14th, 1893, Sister Deraismes initiated a number of ladies, in the presence of Dr. Martin, and on April 4th of the same year La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France, Le Droit Humain, came into being …

In 1900 the new Grand Lodge, with a view to extending its ramifications into other countries, found it desirable to work the higher degrees. Aided, therefore, by Brethren in possession of the 33° the body was raised from a Craft Grand Lodge to a Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Mme. Marie Martin, the close friend and collaborator of Mdlle. Deraismes, succeeded upon the death of the latter to the leadership of the movement, Dr.  Georges Martin holding the office of Grand Orateur, and she occupied her exalted position with distinction, with dignity, and with utter devotion, until her demise in 1914.

There are Lodges in France, Belgium, England, Scotland, India, Australia, South Africa, America (over 100), Holland, Java, Switzerland, and Norway.

We need add only a few words about the movement in England. The first of our English lady members to enter the Order was our highly esteemed Sister Francesca Arundale. Mrs. Annie Besant, feeling that a Masonic movement open to men and women alike could be made a powerful force for good in the world, who had been offered initiation by Mdlle. Deraismes, learned of the continuance of the Order from Miss Arundale, and sought initiation in Paris. She was subsequently created Vice-President Grand Master of the Supreme Council and Deputy for Great Britain and its Dependencies. The first Co-Masonic Lodge was consecrated in London in September, 1902, by the grand Officers of the Supreme Council, under the title of Human Duty, No. 6.* (^Op. cit., p. 25 ff.) (See Plates X and XI, following p. 178.)

With the advent of Dr. Annie Besant to the leadership of the Order in the British Empire, the direct link between Masonry and the Great White Lodge which has ever stood behind it (though all unknown to the majority of the Brn.) was once again reopened; and the H.O.A.T.F. has taken a keen personal interest in its development. The ancient English and Scottish succession of Installed Masters, Installed Mark Masters and Installed First Principals of the Holy Royal Arch of Jerusalem was introduced into Co-Masonry by sympathetic

Brn. from the masculine Obediences, and these degrees now form part of our British Co-Masonic workings. (Plate XII, following p. 178.)

THE CO-MASONIC RITUALS

In 1916, by order of the H.O.A.T.F., the ritual of the Craft degrees was finally revised in accordance with their ancient occult meaning, this ritual being based upon the English and Scottish workings. Certain features, such as the recognition of the elementals and the three symbolical journeys, were introduced from the French Craft rituals worked under the auspices of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite - with further modifications from occult sources. This ritual was approved by the H.O.A.T.F. Himself, who deigned to work it in His own Lodge, afterwards making certain suggestions, which were of course immediately adopted.

In 1923 He further most graciously authorized an English translation of His Latin ritual of the Rose-Croix, to be worked in those Sovereign Chapters R … C who desired to make use of it. The celebration of this ceremonial has enormously quickened the occult strength of our Chapters; and though as yet we cannot hope to equal the old Egyptian working, we are able to some extent to call down and pour forth upon the world the splendid powers of the Rosy Cross.

In 1925 the H.O.A.T.F. was kind enough to allow the use of a Mark Ritual which had been brought into line with the inner meaning of the degree; and in the same year He directed that a ritual of the Holy Royal Arch should be prepared, embodying certain suggestions which He Himself had deigned to make. Thus step by step the whole working is being revised in accordance with the ancient knowledge, and the way to the restoration of the Mysteries is being prepared.

THE FUTURE OF MASONRY

Masonry must surely have a wonderful part to play in the civilization of the future. Not for naught have the old hallowed rites been preserved in secret and the immemorial powers of the Mysteries transmitted throughout the ages to our modern world of the twentieth century; for we stand to-day on the threshold of a new era, which will be heralded by the coming forth once more of the World Teacher, the Lord of Love Himself, who taught in Palestine two thousand years ago. We have seen that human evolution takes place according to a cyclic law; race succeeds race, and subrace follows subrace according to the plan of the Great Architect of the Universe, working in this world through that White Lodge which is the guardian of humanity. The time has come for the blossoming of a new subrace, the sixth of our great Aryan race, and it is already beginning to appear in North America, Australia and other lands. In that subrace, as in all the others, there will be egos of different temperaments; some no doubt will seek their inspiration in the liberal forms of Catholic Christianity, but others will find themselves attracted to the philosophic and ceremonial teaching formerly given in the Mysteries of Egypt which are the heritage of the Masonic brotherhood.

The coming of the World Teacher has always in the past marked a revival or an inauguration of the Mysteries. Thoth in Egypt, Zoroaster in Persia, Orpheus in Greece - each of these mighty Messengers of the White Lodge, who were yet one Messenger appearing under different names and in different forms, left behind Him a glorious rite of initiation to lead men to His feet after He had gone. That great Teacher of mankind passed from human sight as Gautama the Lord Buddha; but the sceptre of the Lord of Love was placed by the spiritual KING in the hands of His successor, whom to-day we revere as the Lord Christ, whose coming we await with hearts filled with longing love.

He, too, will surely take the sacred vessels of the Mysteries and fill them anew with His own wonderful life; He, too, will mould them according to the needs of His people and the age in which they live. For the influence of the sixth ray, the ray of devotion which inspired the Christian mystics and the glorious Gothic architecture of the Middle Ages is passing away, and the seventh ray is beginning to dominate the world - the ray of ceremonial magic which brings the especial cooperation of the Angelic hosts, of which Masonry itself with its many coloured pageant of rites is a splendid manifestation. Thus in the coming days when the Lord of Love who is our Most Wise Sovereign and the Prince of Sovereign Princes will visit yet again His holy sanctuaries - guarded throughout the ages by His great Disciple, the Prince-Adept of the seventh ray and the Master of our Craft - we may look for a restoration to the worthy, and to the worthy alone, not only of the full splendour of ceremonial initiation, once more to be a true vehicle of the Hidden Light, but also of that secret wisdom of the Mysteries which has long been forgotten in the outer Lodges and Chapters of the Brotherhood.

Such surely is the destiny that awaits our beloved Order in the future; such the splendour that will transfigure the Craft in the years that are to come, until within its temple walls once more is raised - not only in symbol but in actual fact - the ladder which stretches between earth  and heaven, between men and the Grand Lodge above, to lead them from the darkness of the world to the fullness of light in God, to the Rose which ever blossoms at the heart of the Cross, to the Blazing Star whose shining brings peace and strength and blessing to all the  worlds.

** This is obviously a confusion in sound, the word being Hache or Axe. Count Goblet D’Alviella has pointed out both in this connection and in that of the Royal Arch that the names in French show that they are not of French origin. The French would be Chevalier de l’Arche Royale, not du Royale Arche, had the degrees originated in France. It seems quite possible that this may be true of the Royal Arch of Enoch, and that the Royale Hache may have been made to agree.

The Brn. of the highest degree were termed the Council of the Emperors of the East and West, Sovereign Prince Masons, Substitutes-General of the Royal Art, Grand Surveillants and Officers of the Grand Sovereign Lodge of S. John of Jerusalem; and the rite which they  worked was called the Rite of Perfection or of Heredom.

There was also an Office or Rank of Grand Inspector, though there was no degree of Sovereign Grand Inspector-General until the beginning of the nineteenth century.

On the formation of the Mother Supreme Council at Charleston in 1801, eight further Degrees were added to the 25° to make the total of 33°. It is supposed that these were drawn from Continental sources. Most of them were previously worked under a Grand Chapter of Prince Masons in Ireland. They received the approval of the H.O.A.T.F.

APPENDIX II

TABLE OF PRINCIPAL MASONIC EVENTS FROM 1717

NOTE

The history of Freemasonry, and more especially of its higher degrees and what are called the side degrees, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is so extraordinarily confused and questionable that I think it is advisable to arrange its principal events in chronological order, in tabular form, and in parallel columns, tracing its development in England, on the Continent of Europe, and in North America respectively. The organization whose story we are trying to follow is after all a secret organization; it moves steadily on its way in the privacy of its Lodge rooms, and it is only rarely and as it were by accident that any reference to it or to its proceedings appears in the light of day. Little wonder that accounts are scrappy, and difficult to reconcile one with another; we are dealing with sporadic and largely accidental manifestations, and no outer indication has before been given, so far as I know, to the inner clue which makes all the confusion clear. That clue is of course the existence of the H.O.A.T.F., who is acting all the time for Masonry the part popularly assigned to Providence - watching over it, guiding its activities in this direction or that, stimulating it where it needs stimulation, bringing it to the surface in one place, and letting it sink out of sight in another, and seeing that, in one way or another, its existence is maintained and its light ever kept burning. He is the true Hidden Life in Freemasonry to whom my previous volume referred; it is His energy flowing through it which has kept this wonderful body alive; while He continues to inspire it, we need have no fear for its future.

*In Robert Samber's Dedication in a Hermetic Tact entitled "Long Livers" appearing in 1712 under the pseudonym of Eugenius Philalethes,

Junior, and addressed to members of the Grand Lodge of England, we find what many have thought to be an allusion to higher degrees. Samber distinguishes between those "who are not far illuminated" and those "who have greater light; ' who are "of the higher class; and "are illuminated with the sublimest mysteries and profoundest secrets of Masonry"; and he speaks to those Masons of the higher degree which is found "behind the veil". Bro. A. E. Waite, who has deeply studied the alchemical tradition, holds that these quotations refer rather to progress in the secrets of alchemy; yet even if that be so, the remarks are of interest, only five years after the foundation, in a tract actually dedicated to the Grand Lodge.
