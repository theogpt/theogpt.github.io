Also, keep in mind that the books are about Catholic Sacraments written by a bishop in the 19th century. Thus, use the appropriate style in the translation.

Prefer the following translations of special terms, unless context strongly implies a different meaning:

- student = ученик
- mental plane = ментальный план
- buddhic = будхический
- thought-form = мысле-форма
- master = учитель
- lord = господь
- deva = дэва
- sacrament = священнодействие
