FOREWORD

These notes on the Church's Year were originally intended to be a chapter in the first volume of this series, The Science of the Sacraments. It was found, however, that that book was already becoming unwieldy, and that there was more to be said about the ecclesiastical year than could be compressed into a single chapter; so it seemed best to devote a separate volume to its consideration. This has also made it possible to add to it a few miscellaneous addresses on points of importance.

The book is to a large extent the reproduction of a series of sermons given for the instruction of a congregation to whose members the ideas contained in it were novel. Amid much pressure of work along other lines I have not had leisure to weld these into a continuous treatise; and as it is not probable that in this incarnation I shall have that leisure, and as other congregations desire information on these subjects, it seems best to let the sermons go forth with but little correction or addition. Occasional repetitions and colloquialisms will no dou'bt be found in the book, therefore; but I hope that it may nevertheless be not without some value to students of liberal Christianity, and indeed of religion in general.

PART ONE - The Festivals

INTRODUCTION

THE CHURCH'S YEAR

God has a plan for man, and that plan is evolution. We have come forth from Him, and to Him we are to return. The oriental philosophers tell us that we are on the nivritti marga, or path of return, and a modern poet puts the same idea in other words: "All the aim of life is just climbing back to God." Christ's Church exists solely to help mankind in this process, and she has many ingenious methods of offering that help. One of them is the arrangement of the ecclesiastical year, which differs somewhat from that of civil life.

Broadly speaking, it divides itself into two parts, the first of which is devoted to setting before us dramatically the various stages of the path we have to tread, and the second to the practical application of what has been taught. Through both parts are scattered various festivals, each of which is intended to remind us of some point which it is useful for us to remember, and to call upon us to make a special effort in connection with it; and to make this easier, extra outpourings of force from the higher world are arranged for such occasions. As it is put in our Liturgy : ' ' The first portion of the Church's year, from Advent to Whitsuntide, is devoted to the commemoration of the various scenes in the Mystery-Drama of the life of the Christ, which in itself is typical of the life of every Christian, as Origen pointed put."

There are four principal stages in that progress. Those who have studied these things from another point of view know that in oriental religions those four stages are called the four great Initiatipns. These appear in Christianity also, but the terms are different. The first of them is symbolized by the Birth of the Christ — that first great Initiation which is the birth of the man into the great White Brotherhood, which is always called in the gospels the kingdom of heaven. We cannot understand those gospels, we cannot make coherent or reasonable sense out of them, if we take the kingdom of heaven to mean the heaven-world after death. If we understand that the kingdom of heaven is a great living community, we shall see why it is difficult for the rich man to enter into it; we shall see how all the promises made about it are literally accurate; otherwise they make no sense at all.

In that first Initiation also the birth of the ChristPrinciple takes place in the man, for the Monad and the ego — the spirit and the soul, to use the Christian terms — become one for a wonderful moment.

The second of those great stages is symbolized by the Baptism of our Lord. We must not confuse this with the baptism which brings every child into the Church of Christ. It is that of which John the Baptist spoke when he said: "I indeed baptize you with water, but He that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire." There is an outpouring from the Initiator to the candidate at that second great ceremony which has indeed all the appearance of a baptism of fire.

The Transfiguration is the representation of the third of these great Initiations, for in that truly the Monad, the spirit, transfigures the soul, and the soul in its turn transfigures the body down here — the personality, as we often call it. All these are wonderfully apt illustrations. When we come to the fourth, we find what many people think a truly terrible Initiation, though surely it is also one of the greatest glory; for then the candidate suffers what is imaged by the Crucifixion, though if he passes the test successfully it is always followed by the victory of the Resurrection.

If we read the account of the life of any mystic who has passed through that wonderful stage we shall notice how closely these events follow one another, and how truly the Christian story mirrors them. We shall see that there is usually some small earthly triumph like that of the Christ on Palm Sunday, and after that there is always the combination of enemies to disgrace the candidate; there is always the misunderstanding and the contumely thrown upon him, and then after all that comes the great and glorious resurrection out of that suffering into life eternal — eternal as regards this world at any rate, for the man who has taken that step need never again be reborn here on earth.

Then after that comes the fifth step — the last of all, that which takes the man out of humanity and makes him a superman. That is aptly symbolized by the Ascension from earth to heaven, and the downpouring of the Holy Spirit comes upon him and upon others in consequence of that his ascent —all truly as it is mirrored in the gospel story.

There is an immense amount of detail into which I cannot pretend to go now; but it will be seen that the symbolical interpretation is at least coherent, reasonable and defensible. There is no argument against it, whereas the contention that the account is historical can be overthrown at every point; therefore those who pin their faith to that historical idea must shut their eyes to a vast amount of what they cannot but know to be the truth, whereas those who are prepared to accept the higher and inner meaning will find that their faith is founded upon a rock.

In drawing up the calendar for the Liberal Catholic Church we have ventured upon a slight rearrangement of some of the minor festivals in order to bring forth this inner meaning somewhat more clearly. At Christmas, with all the world, we celebrate the Birth of the Christ. There is no special festival appointed in the ordinary Catholic calendar as an anniversary of the Baptism of our Lord, though many have celebrated it along with the Epiphany. We therefore have ventured to set apart another day for this celebration, somewhat later than the Epiphany; and because the Transfiguration (symbolizing the third Initiation) comes out of its due place when kept on the 6th August, we have also transferred that, and we keep it between the Baptism (which represents the second Initiation) and Easter (which represents the fourth). So once more these four stages will be restored in our calendar to a coherent whole, and put in the right Qrder.

There is no tradition in the Church as to the actual anniversary of either the Baptism or the Transfiguration. The custom of celebrating the latter on the 6th August was introduced at a comparatively late date; I think the first time we find it mentioned is in the year 850 A.D., and even then it seems to have been only locally observed. It was not until the year 1456 that its extension to the universal Church was decreed in commemoration of a great victory gained over the Turks on that day. So as the original date is not known, we have not, I think, committed any great breach of propriety in putting these celebrations in their true order, so that the symbolism shall be clear to our brethren.

Many of the events described as having happened in the last life of the Christ are commemorated on the days when they are actually supposed to have occurred, although on this subject there has been in ecclesiastical history considerable difference of opinion. The great group of festivals whose dates are determined by that of Easter fall on different days of the month in different years; but they are all decided with reference to the Paschal full moon, just as the old Jewish Passover used to be.

The other group of festivals, being dependent upon Christmas, have fixed dates — the Annunciation on March 25th, Christmas Day itself, the festival of the Epiphany twelve days later, and the Presentation of Christ in the temple, which is commonly called Candlemas Day. There is little reason to suppose that any of these dates are historically correct, but they are arranged to be consistent one with another.

CHAPTER I

ADVENT

With us, as with the Churches of Rome and of England, Advent Sunday is what may be called the ecclesiastical New Year's Day. The Holy Eastern Church (the Church of Greece and of Russia) observes the same custom, but she clings to the unrevised calendar, and so she begins all her commemorations twelve days later than we do.

The first great feast of the Church's year is that of the Birth of the Christ, which corresponds to, and teaches us of, the first of the great Initiations. But the Church in her wisdom has ordered that for each of her greater festivals there shall be a certain time of preparation, and consequently before the feast of Christmas we have the season of Advent — which has indeed a double aspect, but its first is that of a time of preparation for the due celebration of Christmas.

It is not a mere fashion of speech to say that we ought during the season of Advent to be making ourselves ready for that festival. Christmas is not only a birthday, not only a commemoration of the nativity of our Lord; it is also a time of the special outpouring of spiritual force. Such great festivals as Easter and Christmas, in the rejoicing connected with which we all join so eagerly when they come round, are definitely occasions for what is commonly called the shedding of grace from on high; and in order that we may be able to avail ourselves to the full of such an outpouring, it is well that we should take advantage of the season of adjustment. We receive more if we prepare ourselves properly; so we should accustom ourselves during Advent to think daily of the Coming of the Lord, and of the Initiation which it typifies.

The four Sundays in Advent are devoted by the mystics of the Inner School of Christianity to the contemplation of the four qualifications for the first Initiation — Discrimination, Desirelessness, Good Conduct and Love; but no trace of that arrangement remains in the modern Church services, unless it be the old custom of substituting rose for violet as the colour for the third Sunday. As is explained in our Liturgy (and more fully in the first book of this series, The Science of the Sacraments) the Church utilizes different rates of vibration, which show themselves to our eyes as colours, to assist in impressing upon her members the various lessons to be learnt successively in the course of her year. In the preparation-periods (Advent, Lent and the vigils of Saints' Days) the colour chosen as most helpful is purple, because of its actinic, piercing and cleansing properties. Approximately in the middle of Advent and of Lent we find a Sunday on which rose is prescribed; and for this various reasons have been suggested. Through certain curious misunderstandings these preparatory periods came to be considered as penitential and sorrowful, and it was supposed that the rose-coloured Sunday was introduced as a kind of mitigation of grief — a momentary relief in the midst of austerities. A truer theory is that, as the one efficient motive for our attempt at selfpurification is our love for God, this dramatic change of colour in the midst of the season is intended to remind us of that deep and true affection which must underlie and permeate every effort that we make, if there is to be any hope of its permanent success. At least this much remains of the joyousness which should characterize the whole season; for it is not by fruitlessly mourning over our sins, but by earnestly resolving to forsake them, that we can fit ourselves to make the best use of the glorious festival which is approaching.

The Church Catholic has always recognized the dual nature of the Advent season — that it is a preparation for the next Coming of the Christ, as well as for the celebration of His birth in His last life on earth. The Churches of Rome and England speak of that second Coming, and adjure their people to be ready for it; and yet there is a vast amount of serious misunderstanding about it. In the Christian scriptures it is entangled with the idea of the end of the world, so that people who look for the second Coming of the Christ generally think of it as also the end of all the order that they know, and so most of them fear it. In the sermons and hymns connected with the Coming there still lingers a flavour of fearful anticipation of an awful descent from the physical sky, acccompanied by appalling meteorological phenomena. The general attitude is far too much that expressed in some of the Advent hymns which such people sing:

    The ungodly, filled with guilty fears,
      Behold his wrath prevailing;
    In woe they rise, but all their tears
      And sighs are unavailing.

And they talk of them as "deeply wailing," "in deep abasement bending," and so on. Now it should be very clearly understood that all this sort of thing is not only silly, but definitely wicked and blasphemous; and the men who teach such a horrible misrepresentation of true Christian doctrine undertake a very serious responsibility, for surely to slander our heavenly Father and to degrade His children's conception of Him is a crime of no small magnitude. There is of course nothing whatever of that sort among true mystics, who have always known that God is Love, and have never feared any manifestation of His Presence, for they know that whether they see Him or not He is always with them even unto the end of the age.

All fear of God comes from a misunderstanding. The Coming of Christ is indeed connected with an end ; it is not the end of the world, but the end of an age or dispensation. The Greek word is aion, which is the same as aeon in English; and just as Christ said two thousand years ago that the dispensation of the Jewish law had come to an end — because He had come to found a new dispensation, that of the gospel — so will the gospel dispensation come to an end when He comes again and founds yet another. He will give the same great teaching: the teaching must be the same, for there is only one Truth, though perhaps it may be put a little more clearly for us now, because we know a little more. It will be promulgated in some fresh dress, perhaps, with some beauty of expression which will be exactly suited to us in this present day; there will be some statement of it which will appeal to a large number of people.

It will certainly be the same, because it has appeared in all the existing faiths. They have differed much, in their method of presenting it, but they all agree absolutely in the life which they ask their followers to live. We find considerable difference between the external teachings of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Muhammadanism ; but if we examine the good men of any one of those religions and enquire into their daily practice, we shall find that they are all leading precisely the same life — that they all agree as to the virtues a good man must possess, and they all agree as to the evils he must avoid. They all tell us that a man must be charitable, truthful, kindly, honourable, helpful to the poor; they all tell us that a man who is hard and grasping and cruel, a man who is untruthful and dishonourable, is making no progress and has no chance of success until he changes his ways. As practical people we must recognize that the things of real importance in any religion are not the vague metaphysical speculations on matters of which no one can really know anything for certain, for these can have no influence upon our conduct ; the important things are the precepts which affect our daily lives, which make us this kind of man or that kind of man in our relations with our fellow-men. Those precepts are the same in all existing religions; they will be the same in the new teaching, whatever it may be.

Perhaps we may go a little further than that in predicting what He will teach, because there are some other avenues of information open to us. One of these is the study of the previous teachings which He has given. Students will remember that before this World-Teacher took up the office it was held by the Lord Gautama, Whom men call the Buddha. His especial title was the Lord of Wisdom. He gave many teachings, but they all centred round the idea that knowledge meant salvation — that the evils of the world came from ignorance, and that through ignorance men were led into desire, and by that into all kinds of sins and sorrows; but that if the ignorance of man was dispelled, and he came into possession of perfect knowledge, he would thereby come to the perfect life, and to the perfect attitude towards all men and all circumstances, and so would escape from the wheel of birth and death.

Our present World-Teacher bears the name Maitreya, which means kindliness or compassion, and just as the Lord Buddha was called the Lord of Wisdom, so is the Lord Maitreya called the Lord of Love or of Compassion. The great central truth which He will emphasize is that the evils of the world come from the lack of love and brotherliness — that if man will learn to love and to adopt the brotherly attitude, all evil will pass away and the golden age will dawn upon us. Not immediately— we cannot hope for that; but at least men will begin to see for themselves, and to understand how much more is to be gained along that line than the other. We may see how prominently that doctrine came forward in His previous lives.

Twice He has appeared — as Krishna in the Indian plains, and as Christ amid the hills of Palestine. In. the incarnation as Krishna the great feature was always love; the child Krishna drew round Him people who felt for him the deepest, the most intense affection. Even now the religion which He founded perpetuates itself in the most touching devotion, the most wonderful attraction to the child Krishna. All over the south of India many millions of followers still worship Him, and it is of the essence of their worship to feel for him the deepest affection — a devotion more touching, more intense, I think, than any that I have seen even in the monastic communities of Christianity.

Again in His birth in Palestine, love was the central feature of His teaching. He said: "This new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you." He asked that His disciples might all be one in Him even as He was one with the Father. His closest disciple, St. John, insisted most strongly upon the same idea: "He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love." St. John lived to a great age (over a hundred), and when in the days of extreme old age and feebleness he could no longer deliver long sermons, as he was carried about in a chair among the younger people, his word to them always was: "Little children, love one another." So we have some evidence from the two previous births of the great World-Teacher that the central idea of love will dominate His utterances now.

In a certain little book called At the Feet of the Master we have some teaching given to a young Indian pupil (whom I knew well) by one of the Masters of the Wisdom who is Himself a disciple of the World-Teacher. Its especial object is to set forth in the simplest possible form the qualifications required for Initiation. There is no mystery as to those qualifications, for they are given in books belonging to various religions, and are well known to all who make a study of such subjects. In these different presentations, however, there is room for considerable variety, both in the method of teaching and in the translation of some of the technical terms employed. In this little book to which I have referred we get the presentation of those qualifications by one who is so close a follower of the WorldTeacher that we may feel sure that it is practically His presentation. That book clearly does not contain the whole of what He will teach, but we may certainly take it that there is nothing in it of which He disapproves. In reading it we cannot fail to be struck by the fact that it is most strongly permeated with this same spirit of love. The final qualification, the intense desire for union with the Supreme, is given in that book as Love, on the ground that the Supreme with "Whom the man wishes to be one is Himself Love ; and therefore he who wishes to join with Him must first develop that love within himself. I strongly recommend that little book to the notice of every member of our Church; it will be found in many ways a most useful manual, for it shows us clearly in how many ways our present methods of life fall far short of that high ideal of love.

In reading the Christian bible we should, I think, remember that its language is largely symbolical. I do not mean to say that all the writers knew exactly what it meant. I do not think they did. I think they also were in many cases deceived, because they put into the mouth of the Christ words which represent Him as expecting to come back quite shortly. Again and again He is made to state: "There are many standing here who will not pass away until I come again," whereas we know that two thousand years have passed since then.

That idea of the destruction of the world is a mistake. It may be said: "All the Christian world takes it literally; how do we know that it is a mistake?" In this Liberal Catholic Church we worship and we follow the living Christ. Not a Christ of two thousand years ago only, but a Christ Who lives and inspires His Church now; in this day also He has His prophets who know and declare His Will, and those who know have told us that He will come again even as He has said, and that that Coming will be soon now, as we count earthly time. It will indeed begin a new era for those who are willing to receive it. It will be a great change, but it will be a mental and a moral change. He spoke, in that previous visit of His, of the signs which should foretell His second Coming. If we read what is written, we shall see that the great war has been one of those signs; and we can also see that much will be possible in the way of reconstruction after it which would not have been practicable before. Let it be clearly in our minds that He comes not to destroy the world, but to teach us, even as He came before. He comes to reign indeed, but He comes to reign in our hearts, for His kingdom is not of this world.

How shall we prepare ourselves then for this His Coming? Chiefly by unselfishness and by service to others for Him and in His Name. The virtues of devotion, of steadfastness and of gentleness need developing in us all, as is stated clearly by the Order of the Star in the East, a Society which exists to prepare the way for His second Coming, to help us to fit ourselves to receive Him, and so far as may be to help to make others ready as well.

This time, as indeed He is said to have foretold, there will be many who will not heed, many who will be wrapped up in business and in pleasure. He quotes the legendary story of Noah, that men were going on with their work and their play and paying no attention to the prophecies, and the flood came suddenly and destroyed them all. This is the legend of the sinking of Atlantis — a historical fact, though it did not occur exactly as described in the traditions. Christ is reported to have said that just as it was then, so it will be when the Son of Man shall come again. The people will be fully occupied with their business and pleasure, and not thinking in the least of Him, and so they will not know Him; they will not identify Him or recognize Him. We at least must be wiser than that, we who are trying to study the inner meaning of all these things; we must make ourselves ready to receive Him; and for those who will so prepare themselves, be sure that a wonderful and a glorious time will come.

We hardly realize, perhaps, how stupendous is the privilege of being born at this time, of having been able to take part (for we all have taken part in one way or another, I hope and believe) in the great war of right against wrong, which has so recently drawn to a close; and even more than that, we who live now may hope to see the second Coming of the Christ among us. And think what that should mean to us, if we recognize Him.

    For He Whom now we trust in
      Shall then be seen and known,
    And they who know and serve Him
      Shall have Him for their own.

They shall know the truth and the truth shall make them free, for in His service there is perfect freedom. And He has told us that whosoever does service unto one of the least of His brethren, does it unto Him. That must be our preparation.

For us who know the nearness of His Coming, Advent is a time not of fear, but of joyous recollection and of still more joyous anticipation. Our attitude is well expressed in the ancient hymn:

    Rejoice! rejoice! Emmanuel
    Shall come to thee, O Israel.

At the season of Advent we should have much in our minds the necessity of the quality of discrimination in making ready for our own Initiation, and also for the Coming of the Lord. It would be useful for us to think carefully how that great quality can be displayed in our efforts to spread the knowledge of that near Coming — how in our work of preparation we can display the wisdom of the serpent as well as the harmlesisness of the dove. "With these thoughts in our minds "well may we rejoice and sing," as our hymn tells us, for "we are waiting with a hope that cannot fail." Brethren, the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh; yea, it is even at the doors. Already the dawn is lightening; soon shall be the rising of the sun.

    Coming! in the opening East
      Herald brightness slowly swells;
    Coming! O my glorious Priest,
      Hear we not Thy golden bells?

CHAPTER II

CHRISTMAS

Christmas is one of the greatest of the festivals of the Church; it is perhaps surpassed only by Easter, for on this day we celebrate the birth of the Sun-God, as on that day we celebrate His victory over the powers of darkness. Christianity, like all the other religions, was founded in the northern hemisphere, and consequently its festivals all fall at; inappropriate times so far as the southern hemisphere is concerned. The rebirth of the Sun-God after the eclipse of winter was celebrated on the first day which was definitely longer both in the morning and in the evening, immediately after the winter solstice, the point at which the earth turns in its circuit round the sun, and begins to pass away from him instead of drawing towards him. In the same way the victory of the Sun-God over the powers of darkness was celebrated as soon as the equinox had passed — as soon as the day was definitely longer than the night. These festivals of the Sun-God had been kept for thousands of years before the birth of Jesus, so that it was quite natural for the early Church to adopt their dates for its celebrations.

The actual date of the birth of Jesus is not known, but from various indications it seems probable that it was some time in the spring. The 25th of December was, however, selected fairly early in ecclesiastical history, because it coincided with that great Sun-festival, and it was naturally convenient to take advantage of what was already a public holiday. Those who do not recognize the symbolical meaning of the life of the Christ naturally suppose all these ecclesiastical commemorations to be merely historical; but we, who are trying to delve a little deeper into the truths of nature, shall none the less find it interesting to look for other and deeper significations as well.

What are the points of which the great Christmas celebration reminds the Liberal Catholic? It seems to me that there are no less than seven of these points, and I will try to explain them one by one.

1. We must certainly not ignore the historic aspect of the day, even though we know that it is not an actual anniversary. In precisely the same manner, it is agreed that a certain convenient day shall be celebrated each year as the birthday of King George, although it may not be the anniversary of his coming into the world in this incarnation; but it would be both foolish and improper to decline to observe it on that account. Unquestionably, therefore, we are called upon on Christmas Day to look back to that descent of the great disciple Jesus, and to thank him for it, and for all that has since come to the world in consequence of it. It was he who lent his body to the Great Teacher in order that He might come and found His religion and preach His gospel upon earth.

That may seem a new and strange idea to some, but it is one quite commonly understood by those who grasp the facts of reincarnation — those who know something of the might and the power and the dignity of the Great One Whom we call the World-Teacher. We know that it would not be economy for Him, it would not be a good use of His stupendous power, that He should occupy a human body through all the period of its birth and growth, the earlier stages of its life. Therefore one of His disciples takes charge of all that for Him, and He steps into the full-grown and fully-prepared body when He is ready to do so, and uses it for the purpose for which alone He takes it over. For He Himself lives habitually upon a plane far higher, and carries on there a work so magnificent, so beyond our conception, that it is little use for us to try to grasp it, except in the merest outline.

In this particular case an advanced disciple of the Lord Christ took birth in the year 105 B.C. among the descendants of King David, as a son of Joseph and Mary; and to him was given the name of Jesus. He remained in charge of that body until it was about thirty years of age, and then handed it over to the Christ, "Who occupied it for the three years of His earthly ministry. The disciple Jesus was reborn as Apollonius of Tyana just about the date usually assigned to the beginning of the Christian era; and a thousand years later he appeared as the great teacher Kamanujacharya, who left so deep an impression upon Indian thought. In due course he received the reward of his self-sacrifice, and attained the Asekha Initiation, thereby becoming one of the Masters of the Wisdom. We reverence Him now, therefore, no longer as the disciple, but the Master Jesus.

Therefore it is well that we should sing our Christmas hymns and carols, and perpetuate the beautiful traditions which have gathered round the birth of the Master Jesus. We do not necessarily thereby assert our belief in their historical accuracy; for indeed the same lovely legends hang round other births of the World- Teacher, and it is perhaps difficult to suppose that they were literally true on all these various occasions. But we certainly need not doubt that each such birth is a great occasion, and is attended with unusual phenomena upon higher planes, which may have been seen by some at least of those who were at that period living in physical bodies.

2. We call to mind upon this occasion the descent of the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity into matter; and, just as in the smaller cycle we owe deep thankfulness to our great World-Teacher for His descent into a human body in order to help and to guide us, so should we also feel profound gratitude to the great Solar Deity Himself for that willing limitation of His power and His glory which has brought us into existence.

There are many in the world who might say that they feel no gratitude for having been brought into existence — that life is to them more sorrow than joy, and if they could have been consulted they would have preferred not to be. But any who speak thus are thinking only of the very little that they see and know of the great cycle of life; they know nothing whatever of the glory that lies before us; they have realized nothing of the mighty plan of which they are an infinitesimal part. Those of us who are happy enough to know a little of that glorious design cannot but be filled with vivid though humble admiration for it; for we see beyond our present inefficiency to the wonder and the beauty of the future. We realize something of the splendid scheme in which His marvellous love is manifested, and when we catch even a glimpse of that, we cannot but feel strongly moved and full of gratitude that we should have been permitted so wondrous a privilege as that of taking a part, however small, in the glory and the perfection that is to be. Let us show that gratitude, then, by endeavouring to comprehend His manifestation so far as we may, and intelligently to co-operate with it. 3. Yet again, as we have already said, Christmas Day reminds us of that first of the great Initiations, of which it is a symbol in the carefully arranged syllabus of the Church's Year. We should think, then, what this first Initiation means for us — how it is indeed a second birth — a birth into the great White Brotherhood. During the preparatory season of Advent we have been considering the qualifications needed for it; now we should contemplate the thing itself and its results. We should realize how one who has taken that step has become safe for ever, and therefore may truly look upon the great World-Teacher as his Saviour — though not indeed from the mediaeval myth of everlasting torture. There is no such thing as that in nature, and there never has been; the whole thing is a frightful bogy which men have allowed to grow up and to terrify them. There is no eternal damnation to be saved from; the world needs a saviour from such a horrible idea, but not from the fact, because it is not a fact at all. Such a delusion is part of the error and the ignorance which causes all the trouble and all the suffering which we see around us. Verily is the World-Teacher a Saviour, not only for the Initiate, but for all of us; for it is His instruction which saves us from our own error and ignorance, and therefore from much of sorrow and of suffering, which are the necessary consequences of that ignorance.

Not only should we look forward to the time when this wonderful Initiation shall be ours, but we should also make this an occasion of grateful rejoicing that for some it has already come. We thank God for His saints — for the elevation which they have given to humanity, not only by the encouragement of the example which they set before us, but by the actual uplift to the whole which each one of them has given in his own attainment. This uplift is a reality, by no means to be despised or forgotten; humanity is a brotherhood, little as most men recognize that fact, and the unity is so real that whenever one nian attains, all the rest are definitely helped and raised by that attainment. So that should be another aspect of our Christmas joy.

I know that it comes as a shock to many good and earnest Christians to be told that the gospel story is not history, but truly myth. When one says that, people think at once: "You are taking away from us our Jesus, our Saviour. You are denying His historic existence." We are not denying that at all, but we do hold that the gospel history as it is now written is not, and furthermore was never intended to be, an actual account of the life of that great World-Teacher, the Christ. We know but little of His true life-story. It seems certain that some parts of it were interwoven into this myth; it seems certain that some at least of the sayings which in the gospels are credited to the Lord Christ were really spoken by Him. But it is a matter of equal certainty that some of the others were not; and it is also plain to anyone who understands the subject, and has read something of comparative religion, that the whole account is cast in that allegorical form intentionally — that it represents not the life-history of any one man, but the spiritual history of every true follower of the Christ. It is obviously not a history, but a drama — a collection of episodes, arranged as though for presentation on a stage.

This idea, which seems so new to many, is not really new at all. It was quite manifest to the greatest of the Church Fathers. It is strange only to us, and it is strange because we inherit a great deal of the darkness of the Middle Ages. In these days we can no longer give blind faith to something which our reason shows us to be an impossibility. We need to comprehend what this beautiful story means, and it is quite easy to follow that. Origen, the greatest of the early Christian writers, explains the thing most lucidly. He says that there were in his time (and there certainly are now) two kinds of Christians. There were those whom he called the believers in " somatic " Christianity, which means bodily or physical Christianity. He makes it perfectly clear that by that expression he means those who believe in the story as a story, and he says of their doctrine: "What better could you have for the instruction of the masses?" But he makes it abundantly evident that the spiritual Christian holds an altogether higher form of Christianity, in which he understands the inner meaning of all these allegories. Christ in each of His parables is represented to have told a story which had within it two inner meanings. First there was the purely physical tale for children, which described (for example) how the sower went forth to sow; secondly there was an intellectual explanation, whereby the seed is the word of God, the sower is the preacher, and the different sorts of ground are the different kinds of hearts on which it falls. Thirdly, there is always an inner and a still more spiritual signification which is not given out, which in this particular case is the pouring out of the divine life in many planes and into many worlds.

Origen holds that, just as the words of the Christ bear an inner interpretation, so does the whole narrative of the Christ bear an inner interpretation, that can be seen only if we study its similarity to the other presentations of the same great allegory. He insists that all this takes place not in the fleeting world of shadows, but in the eternal counsels of the Most High. He says that so long as we understand the universal truths which are revealed by the story, the story itself is of no importance. Its meaning is clear, it describes the progress which lies before every Christian man. People who study these matters deeply are sometimes disturbed to find the close resemblance which exists between the Christian legend and those of other Saviours long before — pagan Christs, as Robertson calls Theo in his book on the subject. It is true that all the details of the life of the Christ are to be paralleled by anecdotes of other Teachers Who were unquestionably far older in time than He, so that either we must accept the idea of a wholesale plagiarism by the Christian writers from those earlier authors, or else we must suppose that all of them are trying to set forth the same great truth, but are setting it forth each in his own way. That explanation is not without confirmation even in the existing scriptures, for St. Paul himself is made to say in how many ways, and at how many different times revelations have been made. He writes to the Hebrews: "God Who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto our fathers by the prophets " (meaning not those few local Jewish prophets, but all the great prophetai, the great teachers of the world) "hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son/1

We want to get our people to take a more rational view of religion than many of our fellow Christians take to-day. They are unfortunately obsessed with the idea that Christianity is the only religion, and that all the others are just a set of heathen superstitions. That is a most illiterate and ignorant attitude to take, and it shows that they know nothing whatever of these other religions. That should not be so. Religious people should take an interest in all presentations of religion. It happens (it is not a mere happening, for it is a matter of our destiny and our deserts) that we have been born into this race, and into a country where the recognized religion is Christianity. That is not a mere chance. We were born there because we deserved to be; because the best opportunity for us is to come into this particular set of environments ; but other people in every way as good as ourselves, and as far advanced as ourselves, are born into quite a different environment, and we must try to realize that to them their religion is just as natural as ours is to us. We probably cannot imagine that we could have been born into any other religion, just as a man feels that he never could have taken birth as a woman, or a woman as a man. But that is of course mere illusion; the soul has neither sex nor race, and we take these different births according to what is best for our development.

All religions alike are statements of the same great truth, and each of those religions has a special variant or facet of that truth to present to us. There is the religion of Hinduism, a religion at present professed by three hundred millions of people, and professed by their ancestors (for one must be born into this religion in order to belong to it) back through long periods of high civilization — a civilization that was already at its height when our forefathers, the ancient Britons, were running about naked in the woods and painting themselves blue. Their religion has for its greatest feature the idea of duty — dharma, they call it. Their one remedy for every ill is: "Let a man do his duty; each man is born in a particular place with a particular duty to do, let him do it"; and they dwell very greatly on the immanence of God. In Ancient Egypt another mighty civilization was running its course at the same time. The great central point of its religion was what we should now call science — that is to say the mastery of nature by knowing all about it; and the Egyptians laid the foundation of a great deal of our modern science. The very name by which they called their country, Khem, gave the name to our science of chemistry.

In ancient Persia they had another great religion, Zoroastrianism. It has sometimes been called sun-worship, but we must not be misled by a popular title of that sort, for no one ever worshipped the sun as such, but the sun as a manifestation of the great power behind it. Their chief idea was purity. They wished above all things else to emphasize purity in thought and word and act. Coming further down the stream of time there was the religion of Greece, the main point of which was beauty. The endeavour of the Greeks was to impress upon people beauty in their lives, beauty in their surroundings, in everything they had about them; beauty of character as well as of form and colour. Then came Rome with its great religion, enforcing the idea of law and discipline, insisting always upon duty to the community — a very fine idea. Then there was the teaching of the Buddha; in His great religion He also preaches the law, but not quite in the same sense. When He speaks of the law He means not man-made law at all, but the order of nature, and He says that all the mistakes which men make come from their ignorance. If they will only study the divine scheme and live accordingly, all will go well.

Then comes our, religion of Christianity ; its great central idea is self -sacrifice — the thought that the greatest among us shall be he who serveth best. You know the highest title of a bishop is Servi^s servorum Dei, "Servant of the servants of God/' That is the great point that Christianity has to emphasize. All these religions come at different times, each when its particular quality is most needed in the world. Surely any one can see that that is a far grander conception than the orthodox theory that all these other religions are feeble or evil superstitions, and that the only people who can be saved are those who happen to come into touch with the Christian faith. This latter seems a strange and ridiculous idea, but it is of a piece with the self-conceit which made men think that this tiny planet is the centre of the universe; that this particular little speck of mud is the hub of creation, and that all these tremendous stars and suns are circling round it; that God Himself came down to live and die upon it in order that its comparatively insignificant population might be saved, and that all the other populations of those far more magnificent worlds are left to take care of themselves.

No one need be in the least distressed to find the same truths taught in other religions. It is what we should expect, as soon as we get rid of this amazing exclusive idea that we are the only people who ever heard the truth — that of all the countless millions of men who have ever lived on earth, the few generations from the time of Jesus are the only men to whom God thought it worth while to make any revelation of Himself at all. If we can put aside that astounding unreasonableness we shall realize that there have been many presentations of the truth, which are all alike in many respects, though each is put in the way most suitable for the people at the time. Therefore, instead of being alarmed at these likenesses, let us welcome them; let us compare all the different accounts, and so learn from them more of the truth that lies behind them all.

We need never fear that we shall lose anything by understanding the inner meaning of the gospel story; on the contrary we shall gain much. In this Liberal Catholic Church we lay no injunction upon men as to what they shall believe. We put before them the Creed as worthy of study, and we say to them that they may interpret it literally, if they like. That is their affair. Or they may take the higher symbolical interpretation whinh we offer them if they prefer it. Whatever they may elect to believe, there can be no harm at least in their knowing the inner meaning, so that they may have it before their minds, in order that if they hear the historical theory overthrown by argument, they may understand that there is another and more spiritual interpretation to which exception cannot be taken. We shall keep our feasts better, and not worse, if we have a fuller and clearer understanding of all that they mean. By all means let those who wish to do so hold to the physical record; but let them remember also that behind that earthly story there is always a heavenly meaning. We may think of it as existing for the sake of the heavenly meaning if we like, which is what I myself believe as regarding it. Or we may accept it as having actually taken place, and suppose that this inner and beautiful explanation has been invented to fit it. It does not matter. It is for each man alone to 'decide what form of faith he will hold with regard to all this, so long as he understands the high, spiritual, glorious meaning, and so long as he tries to live up to all that it involves.

4. Through the Advent season the Church looks forward to the next Coming of our Lord; at Christmas that expectation culminates, and her celebration is one of gratitude not only for His last Coming, but also for favours yet to come. We cannot but think of that greater Christmas when He shall again appear among us on the physical plane in a body that can be seen of all. For He Himself, the very same Great One Who took the body of Jesus two thousand years ago, is ready soon to come again, and to bless the world once more with His teaching and His help, as He blessed it before. The voice which spake as never man spake will speak again in the ears of men now living, and at no great distance of time from the present day. Those of us who hold that belief are naturally eager to do what we can to prepare ourselves and others for His Coming, and to try to spread the news of it in the outer world.

It is not for us to criticize, or even to marvel at, the arrangements made when last He came to earth; but it can hardly be unseemly for us to note that little was then done (perhaps little could be done) in the way of preparation in the outer world. There seems to have been a general expectation of the coming of some Great One, as there is now; but there was only one John the Baptist, so far as we know. This time the conditions in the world are in every way so different that preparation may be usefully attempted on a somewhat wider scale, and every one who, having examined the evidence, sees reason to expect the near Coming of the Lord should do what he can to prepare His way and make His paths straight.

The idea of the second Coming of Christ takes on a different aspect when we realize that the world is steadily evolving and that the Christ is a mighty Official Who is in charge of its religious thought, and either comes Himself or sends one of His pupils as a teacher whenever He thinks that such a visit will help it in its evolution. I know how strange that idea must seem to many people who have been brought up in the belief that there is only one religion in the world — that there are a few heathen superstitions somewhere or other in far-off corners of the earth, but that our only duty with regard to them is to try to convert the poor heathen from the error of their ways, and to give them the truth which has been revealed to us alone. I suppose it has never occurred to some people that it would be rather strange that we, of all the people in all ages, alone should have a monopoly of the truth. There have been mighty sages, great saints, magnificent thinkers, who had not this truth, which has been given exclusively to a small handful of us. They apparently had not these advantages, and they seem to have done remarkably well without them. Surely it is more reasonable to believe that there are many great religions in the world, and that they are all equally paths which lead up the same great mountain of truth.

I mean that all the great religions come from the same central source; that this World-Teacher and His Department are responsible for all of them. I do not say that He is responsible for the vagaries of the individual believer. Men have corrupted and distorted His teaching ; that is true of every religion. That these faiths as originally founded are all statements of the same eternal truth, we can see for ourselves, if we will take the trouble to study comparative religion. Unfortunately we inherit the ignorance of the period called the dark ages in Europe — a time in which few people seem to have known anything worth knowing; and as far as religious matters are concerned, many people have not tried yet to come up out of that darkness. We do realize that to practise the so-called science of the Middle Ages would be ridiculous. We know a great deal more now; we know that to live according to the hygiene of the Middle Ages would lay us open to awful epidemics; but most people have not realized that the religion of the Middle Ages was equally defective in its statement. Our mediaeval ancestors did not understand Christianity; they took it in the narrowest and most bigoted way, whereas it is capable of an interpretation more useful, wider and more tolerant in every way. And that is the interpretation we try to put upon it to-day.

In one of the Indian Scriptures, the World-Teacher is represented as saying that whenever the world falls into great sorrow and misery, whenever it seems that unbelief and evil are triumphant, then He comes to present the eternal truth in some new way which shall to some extent take the place of His previous statements, which have been distorted. This may seem strange to some, but let us take it for the moment and think of it — that all these various presentations differ because they are offered to different people at different ages of the world, at different stages of the progress of human thought. Let us grasp that idea, and we shall see that no one of them can be expected to be eternal —that, on the contrary, everyone of them must in time become more or less corrupted, more or less distorted; and therefore, just because it is cor-rupted, unsuited for the needs of the world. The world is advancing, and a new presentation from time to time is an absolute necessity. What was appropriate for people two thousand years ago cannot be fully suited for us in the present day. A vast deal more is known on many subjects than was known then, and any statement of truth that was fitted for people then will need considerable revision and addition before it can be made suitable for us. On the other hand, a presentation of the truth such as would now be absolutely suitable for us, would have been insanity, would have been utterly inappropriate, at that time. It may well be that it is thought that a restatement of the same great truths would be beneficial and helpful.

We can see if we look around us that our churches are not being attended by the people as a whole. We hear that in the Middle Ages everyone took part in the devotional spirit of the time, but most assuredly that is not so now. Not a tenth part of the population of any so-called Christian country takes part in its religious observances; I suppose the proportion is probably much less than that. That does mean (and it is no use trying to avoid the issue) that the religion as now stated has lost its hold on the bulk of the population. When that is the case, one way of dealing with the difficulty might well be a restatement; we should call it, perhaps, a new religion. That is not a good phrase, because it implies much more than the mere restatement of the same truths.

The truths of religion are eternal truths; they may be distorted; they may be misrepresented — they certainly have been; but the fundamental basis of all the religions represents eternal verity, which cannot be changed, though it may be more fully stated; it may be put in some new way, which may appeal to the modern spirit. But the great facts are the same. I do not mean that we must believe in any particular name, or in any particular ceremony, but in the real basic facts that in order to progress a man must be a good man, that he must live a high and pure and noble life, that he must practise the virtues which every religion in the world without exception recommends to him — charity, nobility, self-control, temperance, patience, and love.

I have already referred to the weird entanglement of the teaching of the Christ with unscientific ideas about the end of the world. It is curious to see how ready the ignorant still are to create bugbears for themselves. There was an announcement in the newspapers only a few months ago that the end of the world might be expected on a certain day, because the planets were in a certain position. It is absolutely amazing that sane people could be induced to believe such nonsense. The planets have been in a similar position many thousands of times, and it has not been the end of this world or of any other. Men do not seem to understand how insignificant is the combined weight of those planets in comparison with the weight of the sun; they might about as sensibly expect that a cart could be upset because a fly settled on the rim of the wheel. Popular ignorance is a very strange thing. We make our children's lives a burden to them with what is miscalled education, and yet this is the practical result of it all.

Men sometimes say, "The second Coming of the Christ has been known, and people have been looking forward to it for a long time; why should we be specially preparing for it now?" There are many reasons for that — some of them external reasons, and some which are much more private and intimate. There is a new race developing in the world. We ought to know something about that here in Australasia, because this is one of the countries in which this new race is showing itself. If we look round us we shall see that there are still many people who are distinctively English or Scotch or Irish, who belong to the old races; but we shall also see many, especially among the children and young people, who do not belong to any of these ; we shall see a new race springing up which is not English, or Scotch, or Irish, but Australian.

In America there are even more people in proportion who do not belong to any of the races which go to make up that great nation, but are distinctly men with new qualities and recognizably new physical appearance. It is an intellectual race; it is a strong-willed race; the study of it is wonderfully interesting. Now all through history wherever a new race has arisen there has been a new religion to fit it. It is probable that there will be a new religion to fit this race, and if it is to do good it must arise tolerably soon.

We are a great civilization — at least we think ourselves so — and yet there is a vast amount of misery in the world; we are badly in need of some sort of change. There is unrest everywhere; it would seem that the system on which we have been relying for some centuries is breaking down all round us. Something new is wanted; new developments are turning up in all directions. The spread of science is wonderful; the advance in knowledge within recent years is very great — in chemistry, in mechanics, in everything. There is a new time coming. The old civilization has done its work, and we want, we must have, something new.

There is an expectation of the Coming of the Christ all over the world. All these religions of which I spoke, so far as they are active, are expecting Him. The Hindus look forward to the Kalki Avatara; the Buddhists to-day are awaiting the Lord Maitreya, which is their name for the great World-Teacher Whom we call the Christ, Among the Muhammadans, when a pretender started up not long ago in Africa, he gained an immense following because he proclaimed himself to be the Imam Mahdi, the Saviour for whom they wait. He was not, but many believed it. In Zoroastrianism there is also a tradition of a great One Who is to come. Among ourselves there are the Seventh-Day Adventists and other similar societies; and we have in our midst the Order of the Star in the East, which is trying to prepare its members (and also outsiders) for the near Coming of the WorldTeacher.

Why is there such a wide expectation of the Coming of the Lord? We who study the inner side of things know that it is the reflection in the minds of men of the knowledge of greater Beings, the knowledge of Adepts and Angels. They know that the Christ is coming soon, and Their knowledge is in the mental atmosphere; it communicates itself to our mental bodies by sympathetic vibration, and it gives us this great expectation. It is the reflection of the thoughts of the higher Beings Who know.

Assuredly the need of the world is great. None can deny that; and we may remember in a scripture which is older than any of ours, the World-Teacher is represented as saying: ''When evil triumphs, then I come to help." It is not that we do not know what we ought to do. We know the principles, of right and wrong as well as anyone, but we do not apply them. It is not new truth that we want, but new inspiration to practise the old truth. There is a great desire to help among many people. That is one of the signs of the times; but they do not know how to begin. Each tries his own little panacea, and perhaps it succeeds a little, but on the whole it fails. They will welcome the idea of one who knows, and who can teach.

Some of us have been studying this thing, and similar things, for many years. I myself have been working at this inner side of things under definite instruction for thirty-seven years, and on my own account twenty years before that. Some of us in the course of such study have been led to the feet of those Great Ones who do know about these things, those who are in charge of the world's evolution; therefore we can with confidence repeat that which we hear from them, that the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh, that it will not be long now, as we measure earthly time, before He shall appear amongst us. We cannot pretend to tell to a year or two, because what is told to us is always to this effect: "When the earth is ready by your exertions. I shall come;" and it must be soon, because the need is so great. That, of course, is no proof to others. So far as they know, we may be dreaming; we may be altogether in error in what we think; but I would suggest that at least we give direct testimony, which is comparatively rare in religious matters, and so what we say constitutes a piece of evidence that ought to be taken into account.

Look round the world and see how wide-spread is the expectation; see how great is the need; see the new race waiting for the religion which shall fit it as it grows up. There are plenty of indications to enable us to understand that this Advent is not far away.* Although what we see and know for ourselves is no proof to any one else, we do our duty at any rate in announcing the Coming.

* See 4 World Expectant, by A. E. Woflehouse.

Let us then make as determined an effort as we can to get ready for the Christ; let us try to purify ourselves, try to make ourselves what we wish to be if He is to come; and let us help to prepare His way. Long ago, when He came in Judaea, there was one John the Baptist. Let us, everyone of us according to his power and opportunity, be John the Baptists. This time let Him come not with one herald only; let there be thousands of us trying to prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight. For when the world is ready He will come. So let us join in the work of the Order of the Star in the East or of the Liberal Catholic Church; let each work in his own way for a better time, a time of brotherhood and love, for that is what the Christ will preach to us when He comes. Let us cultivate brotherhood and love in order that we may be ready to receive Him, in order that we may profit by what He has to tell us, and to offer our hearts, our hands, our speech, to help Him in the work He is to do.

5. We must not forget that there is another aspect of the Coming of the Christ — the coming within the heart of each individual, the development of the Christ-principle within us." A great and glorious mystery underlies all this — the wonderful, and yet most intimate, connection between the Second Person of the Ever-Blessed Trinity and the great WorldTeacher, and in turn the link joining both of These to that Christ-principle within man to which we often give the name of intuition. Yet indeed it means much more than intuition; it means the wisdom that knows, not by process of reasoning but by utter inner certainty. That development must come to every man. That Christ-principle is in every one of us; it can be awakened — it is being awakened among us even now, and as it unfolds we realize the true brotherhood of man, because we realize the Fatherhood of God. We come to know that our separate consciousness is nothing but an illusion — that we are one in Him. First, one with all who know Him and love Him; and then secondly, by a still greater extension, with all the world, whether as yet they know it or not. To touch that wonderful consciousness, to realize the Christ within us, is not so impossible, for it is being done even now by some. Gleams of its glory sometimes manifest themselves; flashes of wonderful peace and uplifting, so that at least for a few moments we know. And those of us to whom these glimpses have come can never forget them; however much afterwards doubt and uncertainty, sorrow and even despair may overwhelm us, we have known, and our hearts, our hands, our speech, to help Him in the work He is to do.

And those of us to whom these glimpses have come can never forget them; however much afterwards doubt and uncertainty, sorrow and even despair may overwhelm us, we have known, and therefore inside we still know, and that certainty nothing can shake.

True, most who touch that glory for a moment touch it unconsciously, not knowing what it is, not realizing the intensity of its splendour, not seeing whither it would lead them. They know that they have moments of ecstasy, moments in which the love of God reaches them in a way which they never imagined before, a greater intensity of bliss which touches them, which is far beyond all earthly things. But as we progress that certainty will come oftener and more fully, and will remain with us longer, until at last that higher consciousness will be ours in perpetuity — Christ in us and we in Him. For there are those who set themselves deliberately to gain this glory and this splendour, who endeavour to deal with it scientifically, and so to let knowledge grow more and more until they consciously enter into the glory and the fullness of the Christ Himself, realizing the God in man, because they themselves are consciously part of that God. That is the birth of Christ within the heart of man, and assuredly it is a very real thing. Truly in that sense we may say that Christ is the Saviour of the World, for it is through that experience only that man can attain that which God means him to attain.

To develop oneself intentionally as described above is the shortest and the most direct route to such awakening. I do not say it is the only route. One can gain that elevation by intense intellectual absorption, by long-continued hard work and the practice of virtue. But the shortest, the most direct method of attaining the highest rapidly is the deliberate awakening of the Christ within the human heart. For this and for its glorious possibility we also give thanks at the holy season of Christmas.

How shall we know whether we are on the way to this glorious consummation? What can we do to bring nearer that supreme bliss? If Christ is to be born within our hearts, we must be living the life of the Christ; we must show forth His spirit to those around us. And the Christ-spirit is first of all love~ and brotherhood. The man in whom it is developing will assuredly exhibit love, kindliness, tolerance, comprehension — a general growth all round, an increase of the quality which for want of a better word we often call bigness. We speak of a man as great when he is of wide tolerance, of open heart, great in his character; and just those qualities are the result of the unfolding of this Christprinciple.

They show themselves in daily life in various ways; prominently in that the man begins to take the best view of people and of things instead of the worst, that he makes a practice of putting the best construction possible upon the words and actions of his fellow-men instead of (as I am afraid we so often do) the worst possible. We shall find that constantly when we think of the actions of a man, we attribute them to some weakness or defect in him ; we assign to him a motive of some sort. If we were in a position (most of us are not) to get behind the thought of that man, arid find out really why he did or said a certain thing, we should find that our attribution of motive was in most cases absolutely incorrect and unjust, that his reason for doing what he did was much more creditable than we were ready to suppose, and that he had some thought in his mind which never even occurred to us. This assigning of a motive is a habit; we all find ourselves doing it, until by steady practice and care we learn not to do it, but to attribute to another nothing but the highest and the best thoughts. In doing that we may sometimes be deceived, but it is better a thousand times to form a wrong estimate in that direction, than once to do a man the injustice of attributing to him a lower motive and a lower plane of thought than that which is really his. A man in whom this wondrous unfoldment is beginning abandons all unnecessary criticism, and learns to see the good in everything, even when it needs a little search to find it, when it is not as obvious as the more objectionable characteristics.

Another infallible sign of the growth of the Christ-principle in a man is unselfishness, for that is the key to all, the central virtue which gives birth to all the others.

We can see at once what a change it would make in the world if feelings of that kind were widely spread. How different everything would be if each man thought first of others — if each man were willing to take the wider and more tolerant view, and to attribute the best possible motives instead of always evil ones! Perhaps we cannot hope that any large number of people will attain to that level just at present, for it would obviously need the evolution of thousands of years ; yet there is a factor coming into the case for which a large allowance will have to be made by those who try to forecast the future ; and that is the actual physical coming of the Christ, the World-Teacher, to be among us and help us once more. We cannot tell to what extent His presence may affect the people. An influence so tremendous as His; the persuasive power of the voice that spake as never man spake; the facts that His teaching will be simultaneously reported all over the world, and that He Himself will probably visit all the countries of the world in succession; all these considerations show us that here is a factor whose influence is incalculable. He may well precipitate the time when an unselfish attitude will become far more general than it now seems reasonable to hope.

It may be that the world in general is not so far as we think from that higher and grander attitude. It is undoubtedly full of bitter selfishness and unreason, as may be clearly seen from the prevalence of strikes, struggles and disorder everywhere. Most of the words and deeds of the average man are selfish; and yet that average man — a perfectly ordinary specimen — has again and again been found capable in a great emergency of suddenly rising to heights of heroism of which we might have supposed him to foe quite incapable. A man, apparently just like his fellows, a rough and common sort of man, will deliberately sacrifice his life to save a comrade. That shows that there are the seeds of right feeling in every man, and that, given the right power applied at the right time and in the right way, the ordinary man may be raised to great heights.

In the great war thousands of men came forward voluntarily to risk their lives, to fight for an ideal, for the maintenance of a treaty, because our country's word was pledged. Those who fought had nothing to do with the pledging of that word, but they were willing to devote themselves to the uttermost to redeem their country's guarantee. That has a hopeful side; that is a good augury for the future; for the man who is willing to give his life for an ideal now may very likely be willing to spend his life in following an ideal when he comes back in another incarnation. So the world at large may be more ready than we think to respond to the mighty influence which the great Teacher brings.

Few can form any conception of what that influence will be. Only those who have come into contact with some of the great Adepts can estimate the power of the Master of Masters; and even they can only faintly adumbrate the tremendous radiation of love and of strength which will come from that mighty Personality. It may well be that in His presence what would otherwise be hopeless and impossible may be found to be easy of achievement; it may be that under that marvellous influence men will wake up and bring their common sense to bear upon the various problems which come before them. There is nothing too great to hope from such a power as that.

All this separateness is an illusion; we are one in Christ; and to know and realize that fully is to awaken the Christ within us. Remember how it is written in the scripture: "Christ in you, the hope of glory." It is precisely the presence of that Christ-principle within us that brings the hope of glory to every human soul. Without that we should be lost indeed; that is the true Christ, belief in Whom is necessary for salvation — not salvation from a mythical hell, but from the wheel of ever-recurring birth and death.

To escape from that wheel is to avoid the broad and easy road that leads to death (and birth and death and birth over and over again) and to take the narrow and more difficult path which leads to the kingdom of heaven, where death is a ridiculous impossibility — where life, and the increase of life and power and love, and all that that means, constitute the only possible future before the sons of men. The way of escape lies in this development.

    Though Christ a thousand times in Bethlehem foe born,
    But not within thyself, thy soul shall be forlorn.

6. All great festivals have another aspect, and this one has it among the rest — perhaps even this has it pre-eminently. They are all special channels of force — occasions upon which a greater outpouring of divine power takes place — greater, I mean, than in ordinary times. Let not this thought seem strange to us; let us not imagine it as a limitation of God's Omnipotence. For God Himself works by means, and takes advantage of opportunities; and this wondrous creation of His is so utterly one in Him, so mystically inter-related, that as the stars move through their courses there are certain times when certain energies are more readily available than at others — when the bridges are clear, the channels are open; and Christmas is such a time. These special occasions, these great festivals, are not mere commemorations; they indicate definite actions on the part of the Living Christ Who is the Head of His Church. All the members of the Church are members of Christ, and are definitely linked to Him through baptism and through confirmation, and still more through the most holy Sacrament of His Love; so they are always to some extent under His in-fluence. But He has ordained certain methods for the pouring down of His influence upon His Church, and the greatest of all is the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist. Therefore there are special times and special conditions under which the outpouring is more definitely available. Always, everyone of us is in link with the Christ, and yet we all know that we are more closely linked with Him — that the link is more alive, is more vivid — when we come to His Church, when we kneel before His very Presence in the Bread and Wine which He has chosen to be His vehicle, through which He represents Himself to our outward senses.

Just in the same way as that is a more intimate Presence than the Presence which is always with us, so have we an extraordinary outpouring of power at certain times and seasons. There is definitely a greater, a more universally assimilable outpouring on such days as Christmas, Easter, the Ascension, Whitsunday, Trinity Sunday; each of these has its own special character. Such a day as this great Feast of Christmas is a real opportunity for each one of us, for there is a stronger and more definite outflow of divine power then, just because the whole world is more prepared to receive it,

It is well for the student to cast aside old preconceptions and prejudices and make a determined effort to understand the principle which underlies the whole of this question of the effusion of helpful force from higher planes. That principle is simple and scientific, but most people have to rearrange their thought upon religious matters before they can grasp it. Stupendous as is the force available for the spiritual helping of man, it is nevertheless an absolute and immutable law that it shall never be wasted — that it shall be used to the best advantage. This holds good at all levels. In the most wonderful Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist we have the privilege of calling in great Angels to help, and the central point of the whole ceremony, the Consecration, is the act of our Lord Himself through the Angel of the Presence; yet the whole of this tremendous outpouring is made dependent upon our initiative. It is the fact that a priest is ready to celebrate which gives the opportunity, which sets all this marvellous celestial machinery in motion, which makes it (if we may say so with the deepest reverence) " worth while" for our Lord and for His Angels to do this particular thing in this particular way. The Lord Christ is a great official of the Hierarchy, and as such He is always pouring out those wonderful forces at His own high level.

It is an axiom that the highest work which any one can do is especially and essentially the work appointed for him. For example, those of us who can work in the astral world spend our nights in trying to do the work of invisible helpers, to help people in sorrow and suffering. We want to do whatever we can. Unquestionably one of our Masters or one of the great saints could do far more in such work than any of us can do, and yet he would not do it, because he can do a hundred-fold more effective work on higher planes, and the fact that he can do that work marks him out for it, so that for him to do this lower work would be a waste of force.

If a man takes the trouble to qualify himself to do research work in connection with a great univer-sity, it would obviously be a waste of his force to set him to reap a field or mend a road, even though he would probably do it better and more intelligently than the people to whom that work is usually assigned; but it is obviously best for the community as a whole that each man should be doing his highest work.

That holds good all the way through. For the World-Teacher, "Who can wield powers beyond those of any other of the Masters or saints, it would be a waste of time to do the work which they are habitually doing, because He can do something far grander still. Therefore it is best that each Master and saint should do the work he can do, and that above him the World-Teacher should be doing His best work, and down here we should be doing such work as at our level we can do. There is only one point of view that the Great Ones hold with regard to work, and that is that the greatest possible amount of it shall be done under the most economical conditions, so that the power may go further.

The Lord would not turn aside from the higher work He is doing, in order to do anything that we can do, unless it were made, profitable from the point of view of the progress of the whole that He should do that. If the world is to be helped, certain work must be done at the lower levels as well as at the higher. For Him to force His power through from above into the world below would mean a great outlay of His energy, and economically the result produced would not be "worth His while," if we may Venture to put it so. He could do far more with the same amount of force at the higher level; but if we provide the channels for Him, it is "worth His while" to do the work through us, because a little force from above can do a great deal down here if the channel is provided for it.

When the congregation of a church provides the love, devotion and enthusiasm with which the wonderful eucharistic edifice can be built, it is worth the while of the great Angels to come down and help, because the material is already given. It would not be worth their while, so closely are these things balanced, if they had to provide the material on the lower plane, for that would be to them a great trouble, because a descent into physical matter would be necessary; it would not be an economical use of their power. But when we provide the material, it is "worth their while" to intensify it; after they have raised and intensified it, it then becomes "worth the while" of the Christ to make a tremendous outpouring of His power; but it would not be economical for Him to do this unless these conditions had been provided.

What I have written above about the eucharistic service is equally true of the special outpouring of divine energy at these great festivals. On the higher level the divine force is ever streaming forth and doing its appointed work ; when men are to an unusual degree ready to take advantage of it, it becomes "worth while" to transmute a large amount of this force that it may be applicable to the lower level. So once more the initiative is left with us; when we provide the conditions, advantage is at once taken of them.

The sun is always shining, but he is not always visible to us on earth, because earth-made clouds get in the way and shut him out. Just so the divine Christ is always pouring forth, but we sometimes make our own clouds, which get in the way and prevent that divine power from influencing our lives for the time. That is not the fault of the Christ, but our fault. And so in His lovingkindness — because there are so many of His people who are not yet able to touch these higher planes, far above all earthly clouds, where the sunlight of His Presence is always vivid — He has arranged times when it shall be easier for men to draw closer to Him. If we but knew it, we are all close to Him always, but still we feel it more at certain times than at others.

When any one man is in a condition of great love, great devotion, great happiness, he sends up what is very literally a spire of devotion, and that breaks through into the higher planes, and there comes down upon that man a response of love and blessing commensurate with his own feeling. Some people might say, not understanding: "But why should not such an outpouring come always?'' Because he is not always ready to receive it. I suppose that it might have been so arranged in nature that the sun should be strong enough to lick up and drive away any possible cloud. I do not know that it would have been a good thing for agriculture if that had been so; at any rate, that is not the plan upon which the world is working. The clouds do not keep back the whole of the life, the strength, that is being poured out by the sun; they keep back just a part of it, and a larger part of his light, but not the force which keeps his worlds alive; and the same is true of his great prototype, the Lord Himself. When a man breaks through his selfmade clouds he is able to receive this downpouring of divine blessing; otherwise he would not be able to receive it, it would have to be forced upon him, and that is not God's way of dealing with man. He never forces Himself upon us. There is very good reason for that; it would not help our evolution if He did. That is the law, and if we want to receive His grace we must lay ourselves open to its influence. An individual can do that to some extent; but when thousands upon thousands of people all combine to do it, we see at once how great an opportunity there is for this downpouring of what we must call Grace, Strength, Power and Love, which is always streaming forth.

Christmas is a time when that opportunity is near and vivid; but the extent to which we can avail ourselves of it depends upon several factors. First, and most of all, it depends upon how far the Christmas spirit has entered our hearts. If we are filled with the peace and goodwill of Christmas, the goodwill of the Christ Himself can reach our hearts.

It depends also upon how far we have used the season of Advent as a special time of preparation. There are certain virtues which we should have tried to cultivate within us, certain vices we should have repressed; if this has been done, we are the more ready to take advantage of this great seasonal outpouring of definite power. Be sure that this power is a real thing. What we sometimes call the grace of God is just as definite and as real a force as electricity or steam; but it is dealing with higher matter. To say that is not to materialize a spiritual conception; it is rather an effort to bring a great truth down to our comprehension, to make it clear and real to us. We are material creatures; we still have bodies; not only the physical body which all see, but the emotional body and the mental body. But all of those are material. There is a spirit which lies behind it all — a spirit which none can see, which none can touch; but that is far above us yet, and when we can realize it perfectly, we shall be hid with Christ in God. But now, and in the meantime, we live in bodies; and it is through and by means of these bodies that we must be affected. Therefore the Christ Himself pours down influence veiled in material forms in order that it may help us. Otherwise it would pass above us and beyond us, and to us would be as though it were not. And so He sets apart certain times such as Christmas in which this outpouring may descend to the lower level and more readily influence us; He sets apart certain places — such as His churches — in which we may be more readily, more easily reached.

Any man, anywhere, may touch the Christ-Spirit just in so far as the soul within him (which is the real man) is attuned to that Christ-Spirit. But the specially consecrated, specially magnetized places which are set apart for His service make that work easier, for their influence is intended to bring us into a condition in which we can receive that help from on high. We have only to think it over with common sense and with reason, and we shall see that that must be so. A church is one of the places set apart for His service; Christmas is one of those occasions on which it is easier for all to draw nigh to Him.

Let us try to realize, then, that Christmas Day is a personal opportunity for each one of us; that we are not merely repeating an old formula when we sing: "Unto us a Child is born; unto us a Son is given.'' There is actually a definite outpouring of that divine force for each member of His Church, and the extent to which we can partake of it, the amount that we may gain from it, is limited only by our power to receive. Christ is unlimited, and His power overshines the whole world. What we each can gain from this is our affair; it is in our own hands. Let us open our hearts to the spirit of the Christ-Child, to the spirit of Christmas, and that Christ- Child will fill our hearts with His joy and His peace.

In addition to this, we must not lose sight of the fact that the preparation is made not by ourselves alone on the physical plane, for on all great festivals vaster crowds of Angels gather round our altars, and the outpouring is assuredly greater in consequence. Each Sunday Angels cluster round every celebration, for a certain section of that glorious Order has taken it as its specific task to dispense this force in connection with the Christian Church; but on such days as Christmas, Easter, Ascension Day or Pentecost, not only that section is in action, but for the moment almost all their Angel brethren concentrate themselves on this special branch of the work. Naturally that is true not of the Christian religion only, but of other religions as well; for example, on the great Wesak Festival of the Buddhists it may be said that almost the entire heavenly host is temporarily concentrated upon work in connection with that. So it will be seen that there is reason for the insistence of our Church on the importance of observing the ecclesiastical seasons, and reason also for the special request made in the prayer-book of the Church of England that all its people shall communicate at least three times every year, of which Easter shall be one.

7. Finally, there is an aspect of Christmas as a season of rejoicing, apart from its religious side — if anything connected with it can ever be apart from that. This is the aspect which is so prominent in the works of Charles Dickens, who paints it always as the feast of good fellowship. The English-speaking world owes much to Dickens for the lessons he taught about Christmas.

It is a time of peace to men of goodwill, and surely at that time we all try to be men of goodwill; and it is remarkable how nearly a great many people succeed. It is a wonderful thing, this Christmas spirit, this real feeling of brotherhood that is spread abroad on that day. There is a greater goodwill, a greater kindliness and comradeship, a truer brotherhood on Christmas Day than all the rest of the year. It should not be for Christmas only, of course; we should have that feeling always; but since we are overwhelmed by the noise and tumult of the world, since we cannot yet all of us feel that noble Christmas heartiness all the while, it is at least a good thing that there should be one day when all the world agrees to feel it, when every man tries to come as near as he can to the brotherhood which ought to exist all the year round. Assuredly it is well, too, that we should endeavour to impart our joy to others — that a goodly custom should have sprung up whereby on Christmas Day the poor and the needy are helped towards the realization of the great brotherhood of humanity, for our Christmas joy can be perfect only in so far as we share it with others less fortunately circumstanced than ourselves.

So let Christmas enter into our hearts and into our souls, and let us try, everyone of us, to feel then what the Angels sang so long ago — first "glory to God in the highest," and then no less "peace on earth and goodwill to all men."
